                    PROSECUTOR GENERAL'S POSITION
================================================================================

The Prosecutor General requests NEGATIVE OPINION on extradition.

REASON: Facts alleged against the requested person do not appear capable of
receiving a criminal qualification under French law.

================================================================================
                         DEFENSE ARGUMENTS
================================================================================

Counsel for [the person concerned] request NEGATIVE OPINION, arguing:

FORMAL CONDITIONS NOT MET:
    1. Chinese authorities did not request extradition within 48-hour time
       limit (Article 696-10 Code of Criminal Procedure)
    
    2. Interpol procedure was DIVERTED to obtain Red Notice circulation
       (per transcripts of telephone communications)
    
    3. Documents incomplete/imprecise:
       - Absence of signature
       - Absence of date and place of alleged acts
    
    4. Arrest warrant lacks precision required by Article 8 of Franco-Chinese
       extradition treaty
    
    5. Acts of requesting State do not emanate from independent authority

SUBSTANTIVE CONDITIONS NOT MET:
    1. Request based on CIVIL AND COMMERCIAL proceedings, not criminal
       (per documents from Chinese counsel and transcripts)
    
    2. No statutory reference or precision regarding offense content
       (prevents exercise of defense rights)
    
    3. *** POLITICAL PURPOSE ***
       Request allegedly issued to compel testimony against:
       
           SUN LIJUN
           Vice-Minister in charge of internal security
           Arrested April 2020
           Current situation unknown

FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS VIOLATIONS:
    Extradition would violate:
        • Right not to be subjected to torture or inhuman treatment
        • Right not to be subjected to arbitrary arrest or detention
        • Right to a fair trial

================================================================================
                    COURT'S ANALYSIS: PROCEDURAL REGULARITY
================================================================================

GOVERNING LAW:
    - Franco-Chinese Extradition Convention of March 20, 2007
    - Articles 696 et seq. of Code of Criminal Procedure

ON PROVISIONAL ARREST IRREGULARITIES:
    During extradition examination, foreign national is INADMISSIBLE to
    challenge conditions of provisional arrest - no impact on extradition
    validity.

ON 48-HOUR TIME LIMIT:
    Article 696-10 concerns only bringing person before Prosecutor General.
    
    COMPLIED: Arrested March 22, 2021 → Appeared March 24, 2021 ✓

ON 60-DAY TIME LIMIT (Article 12, Franco-Chinese Convention):
    Extradition request must be received within 60 days of arrest.
    
    Chinese authorities transmitted May 17, 2021.
    COMPLIED ✓

ON FORMAL REQUIREMENTS (Article 8, Franco-Chinese Convention):
    Request must contain:
        ✓ Name of requesting authority
        ✓ Statement of facts (place, date, consequences, classification)
        ✓ Applicable legal texts
        ✓ Identity/location information
        ✗ SIGNATURE - None of documents bear signature:
            - Extradition request
            - French translation
            - Arrest approval (People's Procuratorate, July 7, 2020)
            - Arrest warrant (Dongguan Municipal Police)

    FINDING: Documents NOT COMPLIANT with Convention requirements.
    
    However, Article 9 permits supplementary requests to remedy deficiencies.

================================================================================
                    COURT'S ANALYSIS: GROUNDS FOR REFUSAL
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                    GROUND 1: DOUBLE CRIMINALITY (Article 2)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Extradition granted only for offenses punishable in BOTH parties by ≥1 year
imprisonment.

CHINA: 10 years imprisonment - NO DOUBT

FRANCE: Court must verify facts can receive criminal qualification.

DEFENSE ARGUMENT:
    Money laundering is ancillary offense requiring principal offense
    recognized under French law.

COURT FINDINGS:
    • Description does NOT establish [person concerned] participated in
      illegal absorption of public funds (attributed solely to Jun TANG)
    
    • NOT established that Jun TANG sought assistance to launder proceeds
    
    • Reproach only: maintained civil and commercial relationships with
      company described as irregular under Chinese legislation
    
    • NOTHING establishes awareness of fraudulent nature of Jun TANG's
      transactions
    
    • No intervention in placement, concealment, or conversion operations
      per Article 324-1 French Penal Code

ALTERNATIVE CHARACTERIZATIONS EXAMINED:

    ABUSE OF WEAKNESS:
        - Would require loans dated during investigation period (NOT SHOWN)
        - No state of weakness demonstrated for Jun TANG
    
    COMPLICITY IN FRAUD:
        - No positive act in Tuandai.com fundraising operations

CONCLUSION: NO CRIMINAL OFFENSE under French law can be characterized.

>>> NEGATIVE OPINION REQUIRED ON THIS GROUND ALONE <<<

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                    GROUND 2: POLITICAL MOTIVATION (Article 3)
                         *** MANDATORY REFUSAL ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Article 3 of Franco-Chinese Convention provides MANDATORY refusal where:
    • Offense considered political in requested State, OR
    • Serious reasons to believe request submitted for political purposes

EVIDENCE FROM DEFENSE (telephone communication transcripts):

    Proceedings appear motivated by past links between [person concerned]
    and SUN LIJUN, former Vice-Minister of Public Security, arrested
    April 2020 for "serious violations of discipline and law."

    Recorded telephone conversations indicate:
        • Promised IMMUNITY
        • THREATENED with reprisals against family members
        • Purpose: compel cooperation and testimony against Sun Lijun

COURT FINDING:
    Elements demonstrate extradition request NOT based on prosecution of
    criminal offense personally attributable to [person concerned], but
    rather objective of obtaining INCRIMINATING TESTIMONY against a
    FALLEN POLITICAL FIGURE.

>>> ARTICLE 3 APPLIES - REFUSAL OF EXTRADITION REQUIRED <<<

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                    GROUND 3: FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS (ECHR)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Court must ensure individual freedoms guaranteed by European Convention on
Human Rights are respected.

DEFENSE EVIDENCE:
    Numerous reports describe serious and repeated human rights violations
    by People's Republic of China:
    
        • Article 6 ECHR: Right to fair trial
        • Article 3 ECHR: Prohibition of torture/inhuman treatment

SPECIFIC CONCERNS:
    • "Residential surveillance at a designated location"
    • LIUZHI procedures
    
    These allow detention:
        - WITHOUT access to lawyer
        - WITHOUT access to family
        - WITHOUT judicial oversight
        - For EXTENDED PERIODS

COURT FINDING:
    Such practices expose requested person to REAL AND SERIOUS RISK of
    treatment contrary to Articles 3 and 6 ECHR.

>>> ADDITIONAL GROUND FOR REFUSAL OF EXTRADITION <<<
