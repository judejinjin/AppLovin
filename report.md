## Part 4: Deep Dive Analysis

### 4A. Governance & Related Party Deep Dive

#### Dual-Class Voting Structure

From 10-K FY2024:
> "Our Class A common stock has one vote per share, our Class B common stock has **20 votes per share**... As of December 31, 2024, the Voting Agreement Parties collectively held approximately **68% of the voting power** of our outstanding capital stock."

**Red Flag:** Only CEO Adam Foroughi and CFO Herald Chen (plus certain affiliates) hold Class B stock. The Voting Agreement allows them to control all shareholder votes.

#### KKR Denali Related Party Buybacks

| Transaction | Date | Shares | Price | Total |
|-------------|------|--------|-------|-------|
| Private repurchase | May 2023 | 15,952,381 | $21.00 | $335.0M |
| Private repurchase | Aug 2023 | 15,000,000 | $36.85 | $552.8M |
| Secondary offering buyback | Mar 2024 | 10,466,397 | $54.46 | $570.0M |
| **Total** | | **41,418,778** | | **$1.46B+** |

**Red Flag:** Company buying back shares from KKR Denali (a related party and Voting Agreement Party) at negotiated prices rather than open market. KKR Denali maintains governance control while monetizing position.

#### CFO Herald Chen — KKR Insider Placement

From S-1:
> "Herald Chen has served as our President and Chief Financial Officer since November 2019 and as a member of our board of directors **since August 2018**. Prior to joining us, he served as the **head of Technology, Media and Telecom at Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P.** (together with its affiliates, KKR)... **from 2007 to 2019**."

**Timeline Analysis:**
- July 13, 2018: KKR Denali signs $400M investment agreement
- August 2018: Herald Chen joins AppLovin board (while still at KKR)
- August 15, 2018: KKR Denali funds $400M investment
- November 2019: Chen becomes President/CFO

**Red Flag:** KKR's deal executive joined the AppLovin board *during* the KKR investment process, then became CFO. Chen has special Equity Award Exchange Agreement allowing conversion to Class B stock (20x voting).

---

### 4B. Material Non-Disclosure: CFIUS

**External Source (Reuters, November 21, 2017):** CFIUS explicitly blocked Orient Hontai Capital's $1.4 billion takeover of AppLovin, citing data security concerns.

**SEC Filing Analysis:** A comprehensive search of all SEC filings (S-1, 10-K, 10-Q, DEF 14A, 8-K) confirms:
- The term "CFIUS" appears **zero times**
- "Committee on Foreign Investment" appears **zero times**
- "Orient Hontai" is never mentioned in connection with CFIUS

**Red Flag:** IPO investors were not informed that:
1. CFIUS blocked Chinese control of the company
2. The capital structure (convertible debt + 9.98% equity stake) resulted from a CFIUS rejection
3. The 9.98% stake was deliberately sized to avoid CFIUS scrutiny

This represents a potential **material omission** in the S-1 registration statement.

---

### 4C. Non-GAAP & KPI Analysis

#### Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation

| Item | FY2024 | FY2023 | FY2022 |
|------|--------|--------|--------|
| Net Income (Loss) | $1,580M | $357M | $(193M) |
| + Interest expense | $318M | $276M | $172M |
| + Provision for income taxes | $410M | $173M | $182M |
| + Depreciation & amortization | $449M | $489M | $646M |
| **+ Stock-based compensation** | **$369M** | **$363M** | **$192M** |
| + Acquisition-related expense | $6M | $14M | $17M |
| + Publisher bonuses | $0 | $0 | **$210M** |
| + Other adjustments | ~$70M | ~$50M | ~$40M |
| **= Adjusted EBITDA** | **$2,701M** | **$1,503M** | **$1,052M** |
| **Adjusted EBITDA Margin** | **57%** | **46%** | **37%** |

**Red Flags:**
1. **SBC Exclusion:** $369M of stock-based compensation excluded — this is a real economic cost to shareholders via dilution
2. **Publisher Bonus Exclusion (2022):** $209.6M labeled "non-recurring" but represents customer acquisition cost that drove 2023+ revenue
3. **Margin Expansion:** 57% adjusted EBITDA margin is historically unprecedented in digital advertising — exceeds Meta, Google, The Trade Desk

#### KPI Substitution

From 10-K FY2024:
> "Average Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022"

The company emphasizes ARPMAP while de-emphasizing Monthly Active Payers (MAPs):

| Metric | FY2022 | FY2023 | FY2024 | Change |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Monthly Active Payers (MAPs) | 3.0M | 1.9M | 1.6M | **(47%)** |
| ARPMAP | $37.86 | $50.93 | $59.58 | +57% |
| DAU (claimed) | 410M | 1.4B | 1.6B | +290% |

**Red Flag:** MAPs declined 47% while the company emphasizes the revenue-per-payer metric. The DAU explosion (3.9x) does not translate proportionally to paying users.

---

### 4D. Revenue Recognition Analysis

#### Advertising Revenue — Agent Accounting

From 10-K FY2024:
> "The Company does not control the ad inventory prior to its transfer to the advertiser... **The Company is an agent** as it relates to the sale of third-party advertising inventory and **presents revenue on a net basis**."

**Implication:** Reported Advertising Revenue ($3.2B in 2024) represents only the net commission, not the gross transaction value. The company does not disclose gross advertising transaction volume.

**Red Flag:** Obscures the true scale of transactions and makes peer comparison difficult.

#### Apps Revenue — Principal Accounting

> "The transaction price is equal to the gross amount charged to users because the Company is the principal in the transaction."

**Implication:** Apps Revenue ($1.5B in 2024) is gross, including platform fees (Apple/Google take 15-30%). Net economics are significantly lower.

---

### 4E. Receivables Growth Analysis

| Metric | Dec 2023 | Dec 2024 | Change |
|--------|----------|----------|--------|
| Accounts Receivable | $954M | $1,414M | +48% |
| Revenue | $3,283M | $4,709M | +43% |
| AR as % of Revenue | 29% | 30% | +1pp |
| Days Sales Outstanding (est.) | 106 days | 110 days | +4 days |

**Red Flag:** AR growing faster than revenue suggests either:
- Longer collection cycles
- Lower quality revenue (more aggressive credit terms)
- Timing of revenue recognition misaligned with cash collection

---

## Part 5: Downside Catalyst Assessment

### Near-Term Catalysts

| Catalyst | Timing | Probability | Impact |
|----------|--------|-------------|--------|
| Apps sale completion/failure | Q1-Q2 2026 | HIGH | Could unlock $900M cash or reveal segment weakness |
| KKR Denali additional sales | Rolling | HIGH | Further insider monetization at shareholder expense |
| DAU verification challenge | Any time | MEDIUM | Third-party audit could reveal lower actual reach |
| AXON algorithm investigation | Any time | MEDIUM | Fraud/manipulation allegations in ad attribution |
| CFIUS disclosure lawsuit | 12-24 months | LOW | Material omission could trigger SEC investigation |
| Advertising industry slowdown | H2 2026 | MEDIUM | Macro sensitivity with high fixed costs |

### Monitoring Triggers

1. **8-K filings** indicating guidance changes, officer departures, or accounting changes
2. **Form 4 filings** showing accelerated insider selling
3. **10-Q filings** showing AR/revenue divergence exceeding 5pp
4. **Proxy statements** showing changes to compensation metrics or governance
5. **144 filings** indicating large block sales by KKR or executives

---

## Part 6: Red Flag Summary

### Critical (Immediate Concern)

| Finding | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| CFIUS blocking order never disclosed | Reuters (2017) vs. all SEC filings |
| KKR insider (Chen) placed on board during investment | S-1 timeline analysis |
| 68% voting control by 2 executives + KKR | 10-K FY2024 |
| $1.46B+ buybacks from related party (KKR) | 10-K Related Party Notes |

### High (Material Concern)

| Finding | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| 57% Adjusted EBITDA margin (industry outlier) | 10-K reconciliation |
| $369M SBC excluded from primary profitability metric | 10-K reconciliation |
| MAPs declined 47% while emphasized metric (ARPMAP) rises | 10-K KPIs |
| AR growth (+48%) exceeds revenue growth (+43%) | Balance sheet analysis |
| Deferred revenue declining while revenue accelerates | Balance sheet analysis |

### Medium (Monitor)

| Finding | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| Apps segment being sold after revenue decline | 8-K Feb 2025 |
| Agent accounting obscures gross transaction volume | Revenue recognition policy |
| Heavy insider selling (42 Form 4s in 2024-2025) | Form 4 filings |
| Controlled company exemptions used | DEF 14A / 10-K governance |

---

## Part 7: Conclusions

### What Is Known

1. AppLovin is a "controlled company" with 68% voting power held by CEO, CFO, and KKR Denali
2. The company has repurchased $1.46B+ in stock specifically from KKR Denali (related party)
3. CFO Herald Chen was KKR's TMT deal partner when he joined AppLovin's board during KKR's investment
4. CFIUS blocked a Chinese acquisition of AppLovin in 2017 — this was never disclosed in SEC filings
5. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 57% excludes $369M of stock-based compensation
6. Monthly Active Payers have declined 47% over two years
7. Accounts receivable growth exceeds revenue growth

### What Is Suspected

1. KKR Denali buybacks may be at favorable prices benefiting insiders over public shareholders
2. The AXON advertising AI attribution may be more aggressive than disclosed
3. The decline in MAPs suggests user acquisition/retention problems being masked by monetization metrics
4. The sale of the Apps segment may be an attempt to exit a declining business before weakness is fully recognized

### What Is Unverified

1. Whether CFIUS non-disclosure constitutes a material omission
2. Whether Chen's appointment represents actual conflict of interest
3. The accuracy of the 1.6B DAU figure and its relationship to actual monetizable reach
4. Whether the accounting for durable virtual goods (EAUL) is aggressive

### Confidence Level

**HIGH CONFIDENCE** on governance/related party flags — all documented in SEC filings  
**MEDIUM CONFIDENCE** on non-GAAP/KPI concerns — require industry comparison  
**LOW CONFIDENCE** on CFIUS legal exposure — requires securities law expertise  

---

## Part 8: Escalation Recommendation

### Recommended Actions

1. **Accounting Deep Dive:** Analyze quarterly AR trends vs. revenue; model cash conversion cycle
2. **Governance Deep Dive:** Map all KKR-related transactions since 2018; quantify value transfer
3. **Competitive Analysis:** Benchmark adjusted EBITDA margins vs. TTD, META, GOOGL ad businesses
4. **Legal Review:** Assess CFIUS non-disclosure as potential Section 11/12 violation
5. **Technical Review:** Evaluate AXON attribution methodology vs. industry standards

### Monitoring Plan

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Any 8-K with Item 2.06 (Asset Impairment) | Immediate escalation |
| AR/Revenue divergence >10pp | Deep dive on collectibility |
| Form 4 showing CEO/CFO sales >$50M/quarter | Reassess insider sentiment |
| Apps sale fails to close | Reassess segment economics |
| Guidance reduction | Full re-analysis |
