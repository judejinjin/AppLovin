Question 1 of the “Nine-Question Series
for AppLovin”: Hao Tang and Ling
Tang—who is really calling the shots at
AppLovin?
Foreword
While AppLovin’s (NASDAQ: APP) stock price continues its aggressive ascent, the
fog surrounding its equity structure has never fully dissipated. Aside from founder
Adam Foroughi, the market’s biggest questions have consistently revolved around
two names: Ling Tang and Hao Tang. They hold massive stakes through entities like
Angel Pride Holdings Limited, yet remain virtually invisible in the public market.
While speculation about their close relationship is rife, "hard evidence" at the legal
level has been lacking.
By excavating underlying documents from the Hong Kong Companies Registry,
Capitalwatch has, for the first time, uncovered definitive legal proof connecting these
two mysterious shareholders. We have discovered that they not only share the same
business network but also exhibit a synchronization in core asset operations that
resembles a "sleight of hand" between left and right.

I. Target Locked: From "Angel Pride" to "AP
Investment"
Amidst the vast ocean of companies registered in Hong Kong, an entity named AP
Investment Capital Company Limited (Company Number: 3051446) caught our
attention.
According to the Form NNC2 (Notice of Change of Company Name) we obtained,
this company’s predecessor was none other than ANGEL PRIDE CAPITAL (HK)
LIMITED. On August 25, 2021, the company passed a special resolution to change its
name to AP Investment Capital Company Limited. ANGLE PRIDE CAPITAL (HK)
Limited is the entity that held as much as 14% of AppLovin’s shares at the time of
its IPO.
This renaming record is the crucial starting point of the evidentiary chain: it directly
locks this Hong Kong entity to AppLovin’s major shareholder—Angel Pride Holdings
Limited (BVI)—through both naming logic and brand identity. This company serves
as a window into the capital operations of the Tang family.

LIMITED changed its name to AP Investment Capital Company Limited.

II. The Critical Moment: The "Seamless Handover" of
November 12, 2024
By interpreting the company’s latest Form ND2A (Notice of Change of Company
Secretary and Director), we captured a moment of power transfer that is extremely
difficult to detect through public channels. The document records a key personnel
change that occurred on November 12, 2024:

1. The Depicting Director: Ling Tang




Identity Confirmation: The document explicitly records the ceasing director
as TANG Ling, holding a Hong Kong Identity Card (M636***).
Date of Cessation: November 12, 2024.
Reason for Cessation: Resignation/Others.

2. The Incoming Director: Hao Tang



Identity Confirmation: The director appointed on the same day is TANG Hao,
holding a Hong Kong Identity Card (R909***).
Date of Appointment: November 12, 2024.

Deep Insight: Manifestation of a Single Will




Zero-Day Handover: Ling Tang’s resignation and Hao Tang’s appointment
occurred on the exact same day. In director replacements involving
independent third parties, processes such as due diligence and shareholder
approval typically create a time lag. This "immediate handover" is a classic
characteristic of power transfer within a family business or a tight-knit interest
group, proving that both individuals represent the exact same will and interest.
Spelling and Identity: The documents confirm that both hold Hong Kong
Identity Cards and use the same English surname spelling "TANG".
Combined with their parallel status on AppLovin’s shareholder list, this is
sufficient to lock them together as related parties in the chain of legal
evidence.

III. Overlap in Physical Space: Sharing a "Legal Avatar"
The Form ND2A reveals another critical detail—the politics of address.
When declaring director particulars, the newly appointed director, Hao Tang,
provided the following correspondence address: Unit 11, 22/F, Global Gateway
Tower, Nos. 61-63 Wing Hong Street, Lai Chi Kok, Kowloon, Hong Kong.
This address is identical to that of the document’s submitter (Presentor)—CEO
Corporate Services Limited.
This implies:
1. No Independent Office: The capital company controlled by the Tang duo does
not possess an independent physical office space. Instead, it relies on a
corporate secretarial firm to act as its "Legal Avatar" in Hong Kong.
2. High Dependence on Intermediaries: From the tenure of director Chen Wei Jie
in 2021 to Hao Tang’s takeover in 2024, this operational mode has been
consistent. They are accustomed to hiding beneath the compliance cloak
provided by professional agencies.

IV. Iteration of Concealment Technology: From BVI to
Trust
Combining historical SEC filings with the latest Hong Kong regulatory declarations
described above, we can clearly map the complex equity maze constructed by Hao
Tang and Ling Tang to evade look-through regulation. This is not simple holding; it is
a meticulously planned "vanishing act."

Phase 1: Direct Holding and the Vistra Channel (Amaya Era)
As early as 2017, Hao Tang held shares in Amaya Inc. (later The Stars Group)
through Discovery Key Investments Limited. At that time, he used an address at 18/F,
Three Exchange Square, a landmark building in Hong Kong. Verification confirms
this as the office of the top-tier corporate service provider Vistra (Hong Kong)
Limited. Since then, Hao Tang has been accustomed to using "virtual headquarters"
provided by premier service providers to manage his billions in offshore assets.

Phase 2: Angel Pride and Family Proxy (AppLovin IPO Era)
Around the time of AppLovin’s IPO, the Tang family’s holding platform changed to
Angel Pride Holdings Limited (BVI). SEC filings once showed Ling Tang as the sole
director. The evidence from the Form ND2A demonstrates that this "singularity" can
be swapped between Ling Tang and Hao Tang at any moment.

Phase 3: Trustification and Depersonalization (2024-2025)
The latest SEC Schedule 13G amendments reveal a deeper structural
change: Prominence Trust Limited has replaced natural persons as the shareholder of
Angel Pride.




Asset Isolation: Placing equity into a Hong Kong trust (Prominence Trust)
legally severs the direct ownership relationship between the natural persons
(Hao Tang/Ling Tang) and the assets. If faced with external legal recourse
(such as related investigations within China), trust assets often provide an
additional firewall.
Information Blocking: The public can only see the institutional name
"Prominence Trust" and cannot penetrate it to see the Beneficiaries and
Protector behind it.

Conclusion

Through an inconspicuous Form ND2A, AP Investment Capital Company Limited
has surfaced, becoming the key puzzle piece connecting Ling Tang and Hao Tang.
The signature change on November 12, 2024, was not merely an administrative
formality; it is ironclad proof of the internal circulation within the Tang family's
capital map.
AppLovin investors must clearly recognize: although the company is listed in the
United States, the shareholders wielding massive voting power are an opaque force
hidden behind layers of offshore companies, Hong Kong trusts, and corporate
secretarial firms. Ling Tang and Hao Tang are merely two masks presented to the
world by this force—and behind the masks, there may be only one voice.
Preview:
In the ND2A filing of AP Investment Capital Company Limited, we identified a director
named Chen Wei Jie. Further checks indicate that he is also linked to a highly consequential
financial fraud case (AGK/FCD game-based financial investment & trading platform) in
Singapore—described in public sources as one in which “3 million people were drawn in,
and RMB 6 billion disappeared.”
We have completed deeper, cross-jurisdictional tracing and obtained new, up-to-date
documentary evidence. In the coming releases, we will disclose key findings point by
point—explaining why we believe Hao Tang and Ling Tang (of AP Investment Capital
Company Limited, and widely regarded as core shareholders around the AppLovin IPO)
play central roles in the relevant cross-border capital network, and mapping the pathways
connecting it to systematic operations involving illegal gambling and illegal fundraising.
At the same time, we have obtained, through internal whistleblower channels, materials
relevant to identity verification for Hao Tang and Ling Tang, including images and key data
elements from government-issued identification documents (e.g., passports and national ID
cards). These materials have been preserved as evidence and cataloged with unique reference
numbers, and have been submitted to the SEC and the DOJ to support their lawful efforts to
verify identities, trace related financial flows, and pursue subsequent asset seizure.
