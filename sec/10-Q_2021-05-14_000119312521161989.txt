We caution you that the foregoing list may not contain all of the forward-  
looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. You should   
not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We
have based the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q primarily on our current expectations and projections about    
future events and trends that we believe may affect our business, financial 
condition, results of operations, and prospects. The outcome of the events  
described in these forward-looking statements is subject to risks,          
uncertainties, and other factors, including those described in the section  
titled “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  
Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment.
New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time and it is not possible 
for us to predict all risks and uncertainties that could have an impact on  
the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form   
10-Q. We cannot assure you that the results, events, and circumstances      
reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur, and  
actual results, events, or circumstances could differ materially from those 
described in the forward-looking statements. Neither we nor any other person
assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of any of these    
forward-looking statements. Moreover, the forward-looking statements made in
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q relate only to events as of the date on  
which the statements are made. We undertake no obligation to update any     
forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to    
reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Quarterly Report on  
Form 10-Q or to reflect new information or the occurrence of unanticipated  
events, except as required by law. We may not actually achieve the plans,   
intentions, or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements and 
you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Our  
forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any future
acquisitions, partnerships, mergers, dispositions, joint ventures, or       
investments we may make. In addition, statements that “we believe” and      
similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject.
These statements are based upon information available to us as of the date  
of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and while we believe such information
forms a reasonable basis for such statements, such information may be       
limited or incomplete, and our statements should not be read to indicate    
that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all        
potentially available relevant information. These statements are inherently 
uncertain and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely upon these         
statements. 1

                                (unaudited)                                 
1. Description of Business and Principles of Consolidation Description of   
Business AppLovin Corporation (the “Company” or “AppLovin”) was             
incorporatedin the state of Delawareon July 18, 2011. The Company is a      
leader in the mobile app industry with a focus on building a software-based 
platform for mobile app developers to improve the marketing and monetization
of their apps. The Company also has a globally diversified portfolio of     
apps—free-to-playmobile games that it operates through its own or partner   
studios. The Company’s operations are headquartered in Palo Alto,           
California, and has several operating locations in the U.S. as well as      
various international office locations in North America, Asia and Europe.   
Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated     
financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally   
accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and applicable rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for interim financial     
reporting. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in
the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been         
condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. Therefore, the 
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in     
conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes    
included in the Company’s final prospectus dated April 14, 2021 and filed   
with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act of 1933 (the  
“Prospectus”). The condensed consolidated balance sheet data as of December 
31, 2020 was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at  
that date but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. The        
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect  
all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, that are, 
in the opinion of management, necessary for the fair presentation of the    
Company’s financial position, results of operations, cash flows and         
stockholders’ equity for the interim periods presented. The results of      
operations for the three months ended March 31, 2021 shown in this report   
are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full   
year ending December 31, 2021 or any other period. Principles of            
Consolidation The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements     
reflect the accounts of AppLovin Corporation and its subsidiaries in which  
the Company has a controlling financial interest. In accordance with the    
provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 810, Consolidation, 
the Company consolidates any variable interest entity (“VIE”) of which the  
Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company engages in business         
relationships with certain entities in the ordinary course of business to   
develop game Apps. The typical condition for a controlling financial        
interest ownership is holding a majority of the voting interests of an      
entity; however, a controlling financial interest may also exist in         
entities, such as VIEs, through arrangements that do not involve controlling
voting interests. ASC 810 requires a variable interest holder to consolidate
a VIE if that party has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that  
most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and the obligation 
to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE
or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be     
significant to the VIE. The Company does not consolidate a VIE in which it  
has a majority ownership interest when the Company is not considered the    
primary beneficiary. The Company evaluates its relationships with all VIEs  
on an ongoing basis. All intercompany transactions and balances have been   
eliminated upon consolidation. Initial Public Offering and Capital Structure
Change The Company’s registration statement on Form S-1(the “IPO            
Registration Statement”) related to its initial public offering (“IPO”) was 
declared effective on April 14, 2021, and the Company’s Class A common stock
began trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on April 15, 2021. On April
19, 2021, the Company completed its IPO, in which the Company sold          
22,500,000shares of Class A common stock at price to the public of $        
80.00per share. The Company received aggregate net proceeds of $ 1.75billion
after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $ 47.2million and 
offering expenses of $ 7.9million subject to certain cost reimbursements.   
KKR Capital Markets LLC wasan underwriter for the IPO and isan affiliate of 
KKR Denali Holdings L.P. (“KKR Denali”), who is a principal stockholder of  
the Company. The Company used $ 400.0 million of the net proceeds from the  
IPO to repay the entire outstanding amount under the revolving credit       
facility (See Note 8). KKR Capital Markets LLC is a lender under the        
revolving credit facility and an affiliate of KKR Denali, a principal       
stockholder of the Company.                                                 
                                     9                                      
                                                                            
  Table of Contents                                                         
                                                                            
Following the effectiveness of the IPO Registration Statement, the Company  
filed its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which became   
effective immediately prior to the closing of the IPO (the “IPO             
Certificate”). The IPO Certificate authorizes a total of 1,500,000,000shares
of Class A common stock, 200,000,000shares of Class B common stock,         
150,000,000shares of Class C common stock, and 100,000,000shares of         
preferred stock. Upon the filing and effectiveness of the IPO Certificate, a
llshares of Class F common stock andSeries A convertible preferred stock    
then outstanding automatically converted into the equivalent number of      
shares of Class A common stock, respectively (the “Capital Stock            
Conversions”). Following the Capital Stock Conversions and immediately prior
to the completion of the IPO, a total of 150,30 7,6 22shares of Class A     
common stock held by Adam Foroughi, the Company’s co-founder, CEO,and       
Chairperson; Herald Chen, the Company’s President and Chief Financial       
Officer, and a member of the Company’s board of directors; and KKR Denali   
(collectively with certain affiliates, the Class B Stockholders) were       
exchanged for an equivalent number of shares of Class B common stock        
pursuant to the terms of certain exchange agreements. Following the closing 
of the IPO, the Company had two classes of outstanding common stock: Class A
common stock and Class B common stock. Noshares of the Company’s Class C    
common stock or preferred stock were issued and outstanding. The rights of  
the holders of all classes of stock pursuant to the IPO Certificate are as  
follows:                                                                    
                                                                            
Common Stock                                                                
The rights of the holders of Class A common stock, Class B common stock, and
Class C common stock (referred to together as the “common stock”) are
identical, except with respect to voting and conversion.
Voting Rights                                                               
Holders of the Class A common stock are entitled to one vote for each share
held on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, holders of the
Class B common stock are entitled to 20 votes for each share held on all
matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, and holders of the Class C
common stock are not entitled to vote on any matter that is submitted to a
vote of stockholders, except as otherwise required by law. The holders of
the Class A common stock and Class B common stock will vote together as a
single class, unless otherwise required by law. Under the IPO Certificate,
approval of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of
the Class B common stock voting as a separate class will be required to
increase the number of authorized shares of the Class B common stock. In
addition, Delaware law could require either holders of the Class A common
stock, the Class B common stock, or the Class C common stock to vote
separately as a single class in the following circumstances:
                                                                            
       if the Company were to seek to amend the IPO Certificate to          
  •    increase or decrease the par value of a class of stock, then that    
       class would be required to vote separately to approve the proposed   
       amendment; and                                                       
                                                                            
                                                                            
       if the Company were to seek to amend the IPO Certificate in a        
       manner that alters or changes the powers, preferences or special     
  •    rights of a class of stock in a manner that affected its holders     
       adversely, then that class would be required to vote separately to   
       approve the proposed amendment.                                      
                                                                            
Until the date on which the final conversion of all outstanding shares of
Class B common stock pursuant to the terms of the IPO Certificate occurs,
approval of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of the Company’s
Class B common stock voting as a separate class will be required to amend or
modify any provision of the IPO Certificate inconsistent with, or otherwise
alter, any provision of the IPO Certificate to modify the voting,
conversion, or other rights, powers, preferences, privileges, or
restrictions of the Company’s Class B common stock.

Upon the closing of the IPO, the Class B Stockholders held all of the issued
and outstanding shares of the Company’s Class B common stock. The Class B
Stockholders haveentered into a voting agreement (the “Voting Agreement”)
whereby all Class B common stock held by the Class B Stockholders and their
respective permitted entities and permitted transferees will be voted as
determined by two of Mr. Foroughi, Mr. Chen, and KKD Denali (one of which
must be Mr. Foroughi).
Dividend Rights                                                             
Subject to preferences that may apply to any shares of preferred stock
outstanding at the time, the holders of the Company’s common stock will be
entitled to receive dividends out of funds legally available if the
Company’s board of directors, in its discretion, determines to issue
dividends and then only at the times and in the amounts that the Company’s
board of directors may determine.
No Preemptive or Similar Rights                                             
The Company’s common stock will not be entitled to preemptive rights, and is
not subject to conversion, redemption or sinking fund provisions.

Right to Receive Liquidation Distributions If the Company becomes subject to
a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up,the assets legally available for   
distribution to the Company’s stockholders would be distributable ratably   
among the holders of the Company’s common stock and any participating       
preferred stock outstanding at that time, subject to prior satisfaction of  
all outstanding debt and liabilities and the preferential rights of and the 
payment of liquidation preferences, if any, on any outstanding shares of    
preferred stock. Conversion of Class B Common Stock Each share of Class B   
common stock will be convertible at any time at the option of the holder    
into one share of Class A common stock. Following the closing of the IPO,   
shares of Class B common stock will automatically convert into shares of    
Class A common stock upon sale or transfer except for certain transfers     
described in the IPO Certificate, including transfers for estate planning,  
transfers among KKR Denali and its affiliates, or other transfers among the 
Class B Stockholders. Withdrawal from the Voting Agreement constitutes a    
transfer. Each share of Class B common stock will convert automatically into
one share of Class A common stock upon the date fixed by the Company’s board
of directors that is no less than 61 days and no more than 180 days         
following the date on which (i) the Voting Agreement is terminated or (ii)  
Adam Foroughi is no longer involved with the Company as a member of the     
board of directors or as an executive officer. Conversion of Class C Common 
Stock After the conversion or exchange of all outstanding shares of the     
Company’s Class B common stock into shares of Class A common stock, all     
outstanding shares of Class C common stock will convert automatically into  
Class A common stock, on a share-for-sharebasis, on the date or time        
specified by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Class A 
common stock, voting as a separate class. Preferred Stock The Company’s IPO 
Certificate also authorizes the issuance of undesignated preferred stock    
with rights and preferences, including voting rights, designated from time  
to time by the board of directors. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting     
Policies Revenue from Contracts with Customers The Company generates        
Business and Consumer revenue. Business Revenue includes fees paid by mobile
app advertisers that use the Company’s software platform (“Software         
Platform”), and revenue generated from the sale of digital advertising      
inventory of the Company’s apps (“Apps”). Consumer Revenue consists of      
mobile in-apppurchases (“IAPs”) made by users within Apps.                  
                                    1 1                                     
                                                                            
  Table of Contents                                                         
                                                                            
Business Revenue Our Software Platform provides the technology to match     
advertisers and third-party owners of digital advertising inventory         
(“Publishers”) via auctions at large scale and microsecond-level speeds. The
pricing and terms for all mobile advertising arrangements are governed by   
the Company’s terms and conditions and generally stipulate payment terms of 
30 days subsequent to the end of the month. The contract is fully           
cancellable at any time. For Business Revenue generated through placement of
advertisements on mobile applications owned by Publishers, the Company’s    
performance obligation is to provide an advertiser with access to our       
Software Platform which facilitates the advertiser’s purchase of advertising
inventory from Publishers. The Company does not control the advertising     
inventory prior to its transfer to the advertiser, the Company’s customer,  
because the Company does not have the substantive ability to direct the use 
of, nor obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the         
advertising inventory. The Company is not primarily responsible for         
fulfillment and does not have any inventory risk. The Company is an agent as
it relates to the sale of third-party advertising inventory and presents    
revenue on a net basis. The transaction price is the product of either the  
number of completions of agreed upon actions or advertisements displayed and
the contractually agreed upon price per advertising unit with the advertiser
less consideration paid or payable to Publishers. Advertisers purchase Apps 
advertising inventory either through the Software Platform or through third-
party advertising networks (“Ad Networks”). Revenue from the sale of        
advertising inventory through Ad Networks is recognized net of the amounts  
retained by Ad Networks as the Company is unable to determine the gross     
amount paid by the advertisers to Ad Networks. The Company recognizes mobile
advertising revenue when the agreed upon action is completed or when the ad 
is displayed to users, depending on the agreed upon pricing mechanism with  
an advertiser or Ad Network. The number of advertisements delivered and     
completions of agreed upon actions is determined at the end of each month,  
which resolves any uncertainty in the transaction price during the reporting
period. Consumer Revenue IAPs include fees collected from users for the     
purchase of virtual goods to enhance their gameplay experience. The         
identified performance obligation is to provide users with the ability to   
acquire, use, and hold virtual items over the estimated period of time the  
virtual items are available to the user or until the virtual item is        
consumed. The Company categorizes its virtual goods as either consumable or 
durable. Consumable virtual goods represent goods that can be consumed by a 
specific player action in gameplay; accordingly, the Company recognizes     
revenue from the sale of consumable virtual goods as the goods are consumed 
and the Company’s performance obligation is satisfied. Durable virtual goods
represent goods that are accessible to the user over an extended period of  
time; accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue from the sale of durable  
virtual goods ratably over the period of time the goods are available to the
user and the Company’s performance obligation is satisfied, which is        
generally the estimated average user life (“EAUL”). Payment is required at  
the time of purchase and the purchase price is a fixed amount. Users make   
IAPs through the Company’s distribution partners. The transaction price is  
equal to the gross amount charged to users because the Company is the       
principal in the transaction. IAPs fees are non-refundable.Such payments are
initially recorded to deferred revenue. The EAUL represents the Company’s   
best estimate of the expected life of paying users for the applicable game. 
The EAUL begins when a user makes a first purchase of durable virtual goods 
and ends when a user is determined to be inactive. The Company determines   
the EAUL on a game-by-gamebasis. For a newly launched game that has limited 
playing data, the Company determines its EAUL based on the EAUL of a game   
that has sufficiently similar characteristics. The Company determines the   
EAUL on a quarterly basis and applies such calculated EAUL to all bookings  
in the respective quarter. Determining the EAUL is subjective and requires  
management’s judgment. Future playing patterns may differ from historical   
playing patterns, and therefore the EAUL may change in the future. The EAULs
are generally between six and nine months. The Company presents taxes       
collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities on a net  
basis.                                                                      
                                    1 2                                     
                                                                            
  Table of Contents                                                         
                                                                            
Asset Acquisitions and Business Combinations The Company performs an initial
test to determine whether substantially all of the fair value of the gross  
assets transferred are concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a     
group of similar identifiable assets, such that the acquisition would not   
represent a business. If that test suggests that the set of assets and      
activities is a business, the Company then performs a second test to        
evaluate whether the assets and activities transferred include inputs and   
substantive processes that together, significantly contribute to the ability
to create outputs, which would constitute a business. If the result of the  
second test suggests that the acquired assets and activities constitute a   
business, the Company accounts for the transaction as a business            
combination. For transactions accounted for as business combinations, the   
Company allocates the fair value of acquisition consideration to the        
tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets        
acquired based on their estimated fair values. Acquisition consideration    
includes the fair value of any promised contingent consideration. The excess
of the fair value of acquisition consideration over the fair value of       
acquired identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.       
Contingent consideration is remeasured to its fair value each reporting     
period with changes in the fair value of contingent consideration recorded  
in general and administrative expenses. Such valuations require management  
to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to   
intangible assets. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon      
assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain   
and unpredictable, and as a result, actual results may differ from          
estimates. In certain circumstances, the allocations of the excess purchase 
price are based upon preliminary estimates and assumptions and subject to   
revision when the Company receives final information, including appraisals  
and other analyses. During the measurement period, which is one year from   
the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the assets      
acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. 
Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments   
are recorded to earnings. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as         
incurred. For transactions accounted for as asset acquisitions, the cost,   
including certain transaction costs, is allocated to the assets acquired on 
the basis of relative fair values. The Company generally includes contingent
consideration in the cost of the assets acquired only when the uncertainty  
is resolved. The Company recognizes contingent consideration adjustments to 
the cost of the acquired assets prospectively using the straight-line method
over the remaining useful life of the assets. No goodwill is recognized in  
asset acquisitions. Services and Development Agreements The Company enters  
into strategic agreements with mobile gaming studios (“Partner Studios”).   
The Company has historically allowed these Partner Studios to continue their
operations with a significant degree of autonomy. In some cases, the Company
bought Apps from Partner Studios and entered into service and development   
agreements whereby Partner Studios provide support in improving existing    
Apps and developing new Apps. The substantial majority of payments          
associated with service agreements for existing Apps are expensed to        
research and development when the services are rendered as the payments     
primarily relate to developing enhancements for the Apps. Payments for new  
Apps associated with development agreements are generally made in connection
with the development of a particular App, and therefore, the Company is     
subject to development risk prior to the release of the App. Accordingly,   
payments that are due prior to completion of an App are generally expensed  
to research and development over the development period as the services are 
incurred. Payments due after completion of an App are generally capitalized 
and expensed as cost of revenue. See Note 6, “Acquisitions” for additional  
information. Recent Accounting Pronouncements (Issued and Not Yet Adopted)  
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt—Debt with Conversion and  
Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in    
Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible           
Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity, to simplify the        
accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of        
liabilities and equity, including convertible instruments and contracts on  
an entity’s own equity. The standard eliminates beneficial conversion       
feature and cash conversion models resulting in more convertible instruments
being accounted for as a single unit; and simplifies classification of debt 
on the balance sheet and earnings per share calculation. These changes will 
become effective for the Company on January 1, 2022. The Company is         
currently evaluating the potential impact of these changes.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements (Issued and Adopted) In December 2019, the 
FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the          
Accounting for Income Taxes.The ASU impacts various topic areas within ASC  
740, including accounting for taxes under hybrid tax regimes, accounting for
increases in goodwill, allocation of tax amounts to separate company        
financial statements within a group that files a consolidated tax return,   
intra period tax allocation, interim period accounting, and accounting for  
ownership changes in investments, among other minor codification            
improvements. The Company adopted this ASU on January 1, 2021 with no       
material financial statement impact upon adoption. In January 2020, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2020-01, Investments—Equity Securities (Topic 321),          
Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), and Derivatives   
and Hedging (Topic 815),which clarifies the interaction of the accounting   
for equity securities under Topic 321, the accounting for equity method     
investments in Topic 323, and the accounting for certain forward contracts  
and purchased options in Topic 815. The Company adopted this ASU on January 
1, 2021 with no material financial statement impact upon adoption.

Convertible Security In November 2020, the Company issued a convertible     
security as part of the consideration exchanged for certain mobile game Apps
acquired from an independent foreign-based mobile game developer. The       
Company elected to account for the convertible security using the fair value
option. Under the fair value option, the financial liability is initially   
measured at its issue-date estimated fair value and subsequently remeasured 
at estimated fair value on a recurring basis at each reporting period date. 
The fair value of the convertible security was determined using the         
probability-weighted expected return method (“PWERM”). This valuation       
methodology is based on unobservable estimates and judgements, and therefore
is classified as a Level 3 fair value measurement. The significant          
unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the convertible    
security is the expected timing of occurrence of an IPO. Fair value         
measurements are highly sensitive to changes in this input and significant  
changes in this input would result in a significantly higher or lower fair  
value. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Company recorded a    
total loss of $ 0.7million in other income, net in the Company’s condensed  
consolidated statements of operations due to the change in fair value of the
convertible security. The convertible security is included in deferred      
acquisition costs, current, in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance 
sheets. Embedded Derivative Loans issued under Company’s credit agreement   
with the lenders party thereto and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative 
agent for the lenders (the “Credit Agreement”) contain certain interest     
adjustment features which were determined to be an embedded derivative      
requiring bifurcation and separate accounting as the features are not       
clearly and closely related to the host debt instrument. The embedded       
derivative was initially valued and remeasured using the “with-and-without” 
method. The “with-and-without” methodology involves valuing the whole       
instrument with and without the embedded derivative using a discounted cash 
flow approach. The difference of the estimated fair value between the       
instrument with the embedded derivative and the instrument without the      
embedded derivative is the fair value of the embedded derivative. This      
valuation methodology is based on unobservable estimates and judgements, and
therefore is classified as a Level 3 fair value measurement. The significant
unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the embedded       
derivative is the expected timing of occurrence of an IPO. Fair value       
measurements are highly sensitive to changes in these inputs and significant
changes in these inputs would result in a significantly higher or lower fair
value. The initial fair value of the embedded derivative was determined to  
be nominal for term loans issued prior to 2021 and$ 5.6 million for the term
loans issued in February 2021, which was accounted for as a reduction to the
carrying amount of the term loans. For the three months ended March 31, 2021
and 2020, the Company recorded a total gain of$ 6.6 million and nil,        
respectively, in other income, net in the Company’s condensed consolidated  
statements of operations due to the change in fair value of the embedded    
derivative. Marketable Equity Securities The Company’s marketable equity    
securities consist entirely of its investment in the ordinary shares of     
Huuuge, Inc., a foreign based independent mobile game developer, which      
completed its initial public offering and became listed on the Warsaw Stock 
Exchange in the first quarter of 2021. The Company had carried the          
investment at cost in other assets on the Company’s consolidated balance    
sheets in prior fiscal years. The cost basis of the investment was          
immaterial. The fair value of the marketable equity securities was based on 
the quoted market price of Huuuge, Inc.’s ordinary shares as of March 31,   
2021, and therefore was classified as a Level 1 fair value measurement. For 
the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Company recorded a total         
unrealized gain of $ 5.4million in other income, net in the Company’s       
condensed consolidated statements of operations as a result of remeasuring  
the investment to fair value. 1 5

5. Contingencies Contingencies From time to time, the Company may have      
certain contingent liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of business
activities. The Company accrues a liability for such matters when it is     
probable that future expenditures will be made, and such expenditures can be
reasonably estimated. Letters of Credit As of March 31, 2021 and December   
31, 2020 the Company had outstanding letters of credit in the aggregate     
amount of $ 11.1million, which were issued as security for certain leased   
office facilities under the Credit Agreement. These letters of credit have  
never been drawn upon. Legal Proceedings The Company is involved from time  
to time in litigation, claims, and proceedings. The outcomes of the         
Company’s legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to     
significant uncertainty. The Company records a liability when it is probable
that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If
it is determined that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of
loss can be estimated, the reasonably possible loss is disclosed. The       
Company evaluates developments in legal matters that could affect the amount
of liability that has been previously accrued, and related reasonably       
possible losses disclosed, and makes adjustments as appropriate. Significant
judgment is required to determine the likelihood of matters and the         
estimated amount of losses related to such matters. To date, losses in      
connection with legal proceedings have not been material. The Company       
expenses legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.               
Indemnifications The Company enters into indemnification provisions under   
agreements with other parties in the ordinary course of business, including 
certain customers, business partners, investors, contractors and the        
Company’s officers, directors and certain employees. It is not possible to  
determine the maximum potential loss under these indemnification provisions 
due to the Company’s limited history of prior indemnification claims and the
unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular provision. To    
date, losses recorded in the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of 
operations in connection with the indemnification provisions have not been  
material. As of March 31, 2021, the Company did not have any material       
indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible. 1 6       
                                                                            
  Table of Contents                                                         
                                                                            
Non-incomeTaxes The Company may be subject to audit by various tax          
authorities with regard to non-incometax matters. The subject matter of non-
incometax audits primarily arises from different interpretations on tax     
treatment and tax rates applied. The Company accrues liabilities for non-   
incometaxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated         
agreements with, these tax authorities when a loss is probable and          
reasonably estimable, and the expense is recorded as a reduction of revenue 
or to general and administrative expenses depending on the nature of the    
liability.                                                                  
6. Acquisitions                                                             
2021 Acquisitions                                                           
In February 2021, the Company signed a share purchase agreement with Adjust
GmbH, a leading mobile app attribution, measurement and analytics company in
Germany, which agreement, as amended and restated and further amended,
provides for the Company to acquire all the outstanding shares of Adjust
GmbH for (i) $ 598.0million in cash, subject to certain purchase price
adjustments, (ii) convertible securities that automatically convert into an
aggregate number of shares of the Company’s Class A common stock determined
by dividing $ 352.0million by the volume-weighted average trading price per
share of our Class A common stock over any 10consecutive full trading day
period (chosen by the selling stockholder representative under the Purchase
Agreement) within 20 trading days commencing with and following the closing
of the IPO (the “Conversion Price”); and (iii) the assumption of up to$ 40.0
million in the aggregate of debt, accrued interest, and fees of Adjust, in
each case upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the share purchase
agreement. The transaction closed on April 20, 2021. The 20-day trading
period expired on May 12. As of the date of issuance of these condensed
consolidated financial statements, the Company has not received any notice
designating the 10-day period for determining the Conversion Price. Due to
the timing of this transaction close, as of the date of issuance of these
condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company is in the process
of finalizing the valuation and related accounting impact.
During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Company recognized earn-
out costs of $ 27.2 million related to the Zenlife acquisition closed in
2020. These earn-out costs increased the book value of the acquired mobile
game Apps, and are amortized over the remaining useful life of the
originally acquired game Apps.
During the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Company also acquired
certain mobile game Apps for an aggregated consideration of $ 8.6million .
In January 2021 the Company paid $ 60.0 million to Recoded, an independent
foreign-based mobile game developer, in relation to a new game App acquired
in 2020. In February 2021, the Company paid an additional $ 90.0million to
Recoded related to deferred cash consideration on the acquisition closed in
2019.
2020 Acquisitions                                                           
Geewa —On January 31, 2020, the Company acquired Geewa A.S. (“Geewa”), a
privately held company specializing in mobile gaming. The transaction is
expected to expand the Company’s Apps portfolio and has been accounted for
as a business combination. The Company purchased all of the outstanding
shares of the capital stock of Geewa for a total consideration of $ 25.6
million of which $ 23.5 million was paid in cash and the unpaid balance was
attributed to a $ 2.1 million indemnity holdback that was paid in January
2021. Transaction costs incurred by the Company in connection with the
acquisition, including professional fees, were $ 0.3 million.

  Table of Contents                                                         
                                                                            
The income approach was used to value the developed Apps and tradename.     
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of 
the identifiable assets and assumed liabilities acquired and is primarily   
attributable to the assembled workforce and expected synergies at the time  
of the acquisition. Goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. Pro forma  
results of operations have not been presented because the effect of the     
acquisition was not material to the condensed consolidated statements of    
operations. In March 2020, the Company completed a transaction to acquire a 
certain mobile game App from an independent foreign-based mobile game       
developer in exchange for an upfront cash consideration of $ 30.0 million   
and earn-out payments. The transaction was accounted for as an asset        
acquisition with the entire upfront cash consideration allocated to the     
acquired mobile game App. Additionally, the Company entered into a service  
and development agreement with the independent mobile game developer to     
support the initially acquired game App as well as to develop new game Apps.
The earn-out payments are based on a predetermined percentage of revenue net
of certain direct costs generated by the initially acquired game App, or    
additional game Apps developed under the service and development agreement, 
over the term of the agreement, which is initially two years, but which may 
renew for an additional two-year term. During the three months ended March  
31, 2021 and 2020, the earn-outs incurred in connection with this           
acquisition were immaterial.

8. Credit Agreement On August 15, 2018, the Company entered into a Credit   
Agreement which provided for senior secured term loans in an aggregate      
principal amount of $ 820.0million (the “Closing Term Loans”) and a         
revolving credit facility of $ 50.0million. On April 23, 2019, the Credit   
Agreement was amended to increase the senior secured term loan facility by $
400.0 million, on terms identical to those applicable to the Closing Term   
Loans (together with the Closing Term Loans, the “Initial Term Loans”). On  
April 27, 2020, the Credit Agreement was further amended to modify certain  
negative covenants. On May 6, 2020, the Credit Agreement was further amended
(the “Third Amendment”) to increase the senior secured term loan facility by
an additional $ 300.0 million (the “Third Amendment Term Loans”). On October
27, 2020, the Credit Agreement was further amended to increase the aggregate
principal amount of the revolving credit facility by an additional $        
540.0million. On November 30, 2020, the Company borrowed $ 150.0million     
under the revolving credit facility. On February 12, 2021, the Company      
amended the Credit Agreement to 1) increase the senior secured term loan    
facility by an aggregate principal amount of $ 597.8 million (the “Fifth    
Amendment Term Loans”, and together with the Initial Term Loans, the “Term  
Loans”), on terms identical to those applicable to the existing Initial Term
Loans, the proceeds of which was partially used to repay in full the        
outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest of the Third Amendment
Term Loans, totaling $ 298.2 million, in accordance with the pre-existing   
early redemption option in the Credit Agreement, and 2) increase the        
aggregate principal amount of the revolving credit facility by an additional
$ 10.0 million, on terms identical to those applicable to the existing      
revolving credit facility. According to the amended Credit Agreement, the   
Company is required to make equal quarterly repayments of $ 4.6 million with
respect to the Term Loans. In connection with this amendment, the Company   
paid $ 0.8 million in fees to KKR Capital Markets LLC, who is affiliated    
with KKR Denali, one of the Company’s principal stockholders. The Company   
evaluated the accounting for the Fifth Amendment Term Loans on a creditor-  
by-creditorbasis. For existing creditors who participated in the Fifth      
Amendment Term Loans, the transaction was accounted for as a debt           
modification because the present value of the cash flows between the two    
debt instruments before and after the transaction was less tha n 10 %. For  
new creditors, the transaction was accounted for as an issuance of new debt.
As a result, $ 2.9 million of the $ 3.5 million third-party issuance costs  
related to the modified debt was recorded in other income, net on the       
Company’s condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three     
months ended March 31, 2021, with the remaining$ 0.6 million related to the 
new debt recorded as a reduction to the carrying amount of the Term Loans.  
In addition, the Company recorded $ 5.6 million for an embedded derivative  
related to the contingent interest adjustment feature of the Fifth Amendment
Term Loans, which was bifurcated and accounted for separately as the feature
is not clearly and closely related to the host instrument. For details      
regarding the fair value measurement of the embedded derivative, see Note 4.
The debt discount related to the deferred third-party issuance costs, the   
bifurcated embedded derivative and the unamortized debt discount of the     
Initial Term Loans that were modified as part of the amendment is being     
amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the  
remaining contractual term of the Term Loans. The Company accounted for the 
early repayment of the Third Amendment Term loans as a debt extinguishment. 
As a result, the Company recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of $ 16.9 
million during the three months ended March 31, 2021, which was recorded in 
interest expense and loss on extinguishment of debt on the Company’s        
condensed consolidated statements of operations. The loss on debt           
extinguishment consisted primarily of the unamortized original issue        
discount and debt issuance cost. On March 31, 2021, the Company drew down an
additional $ 250.0million from the Company’s $ 600.0million revolving credit
facility. A lender under the revolving credit facility is an affiliate of   
KKR Denali, a principal stockholder of the Company. Following such draw down
,the Company had an aggregate amount of $ 400.0 million outstanding under   
the revolving credit facility, which was repaid in full with the net        
proceeds from the IPO in April 2021. As of March 31, 2021, the Company was  
in compliance with all of the covenants. After the effectiveness of the IPO 
Registration Statement, the applicable margins for both the Term Loans and  
the Revolving Credit Loans were reduced by 0.25% on April 16, 2021 in       
accordance with the pre-existingterms of the Credit Agreement. 9. Cash Flow 
Hedges The Company manages exposure to market risk associated with          
fluctuating interest rates with the use of interest rate derivative         
financial instruments, namely interest rate swaps. The Company does not use 
derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. On November 14, 2018, the  
Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement as part of its interest
rate risk management strategy in connection with the term loan. The notional
amount for the swap was $ 410.0million. The swap was a receive-variable     
(one-monthLIBOR) and pay-fixed( 2.9065%) interest rate swapwith settlement  
date commencing on the last calendar day of each month and reset date on    
first day of each month beginning December 31, 2018.                        
                                     19                                     
                                                                            
  Table of Contents                                                         
                                                                            
The Company applied the hedge accounting provisions of the critical terms   
match hedge, and formally documented at inception all relationships between 
hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management        
objectives and strategies for undertaking the various hedges. The critical  
terms of the swap and hedged item coincided (notional amount, interest rate 
reset dates, interest rate payment dates, and underlying index), the hedge  
was expected to offset changes in expected cash flows due to fluctuations in
one-monthLIBOR over the term of the hedge. Therefore, the effectiveness of  
the hedge relationship was assessed each quarter by comparing the current   
terms of the swap and the debt to assure they continued to coincide and     
through an evaluation of the continued ability of the counterparty to the   
swap to honor its obligations under the swap. Had the critical terms no     
longer matched exactly, hedge effectiveness (both prospective and           
retrospective) would have to be assessed by evaluating the cumulative       
dollar-offset ratio for the actual derivative and the hedged item.          
Unrealized changes in the fair value of derivatives accounted for as a      
critical term match hedge were reported in other comprehensive income (loss)
and subsequently reclassified to earnings in the same period or periods     
during which the hedged forecasted transaction affected earnings. The       
interest rate swap contract expired on December 31, 2020 and the settlement 
value of the interest rate swap liability was reclassified to interest      
expense and loss on settlement of debt For the three months ended March 31, 
2020, the Company recognized$ 1.3 million of realized loss related to hedged
transaction, which were recorded in interest expense and loss on settlement 
of debt in the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of operations. As
of March 31, 2020, the settlement value of the interest rate swap liability 
before tax effect was$ 7.7 million and was included in accrued liabilities  
and reported in other comprehensive income net of tax effect. 10. Stock-

2011 Equity Incentive Plan                                                  
The Company’s 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2011 Plan”) provides for the

For the three months ended March 31, 2021 ,total stock-based compensation
expense included $ 0.3million associated with awards that may be settled
with one of the Company’s subsidiaries.

In January 2021, a new director was elected to serve on the Company’s board
of directors and received options to purchase a total of 206,000shares of
the Company’s common stock under the 2011 Plan. With respect to
21,000shares, 1/12th of the shares will vest, subject to such director’s
continued role as a service provider to the Company, on April 21, 2021, and
thereafter, 1/12th of the shares vesting every three months; provided that
100% of any unvested shares covered by the option will vest immediately
prior to the closing of an Acquisition or Other Combination (each as defined
in the 2011 Plan). The options to purchase 185,000shares were fully vested
on the date of grant and such options were exercised in full in January
2021.

Early Exercise of Stock Options—Subject to the Board’s approval, the 2011
Plan allows for the early exercise of options granted. Under the terms of
the 2011 Plan, option holders, upon early exercise, must sign a restricted
stock purchase agreement that gives the Company the right to repurchase any
unvested shares, at the original exercise price, in the event the optionees’
employment terminates for any reason. The right to exercise options before
they are vested does not change existing vesting schedules in any way and
the early exercised options may not be sold or transferred before they are
vested. The repurchase right lapses over time as the shares vest at the same
rate as the original option vesting schedule. The cash amounts received in
exchange for these early exercised shares are recorded as a liability on the
accompanying balance sheets and reclassified into common stock and
additional paid-in-capitalas the shares vest. The Company’s right to
repurchase these shares lapses by 1/4 thof the shares on the one-
yearanniversary of the vesting start date and ratably each month over the
next 36-months.The Company has 458,499and zeroshares of Class A common stock
subject to repurchase as of March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The
liability for the shares of Class A common stock subject to repurchase as of
March 31, 2021 was $ 2.7million, which was included in the accrued
liabilities in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets.

During 2020 and 2019, the Company provided financing to certain employees in
the form of promissory notes to early exercise stock options. These
promissory notes are partially collateralized by shares and in-substance are
nonrecourse. For accounting purposes, exercised options via nonrecourse
promissory notes are not substantive and are continued to be treated as
options. In February 2021, promissory notes issued to executive officers in
the amount of $ 20.9 million were settled through either share repurchase,
in the amount of $ 17.2 million, or cash payment, in the amount of $ 3.7
million. In connection with the repurchase of shares, the Company
accelerated vesting of 60,968 shares of Class A common stock for one of the
Company’s officers. The acceleration of vesting was accounted as an option
modification with an immaterial impact to the stock-based compensation
expense. As of March 31, 2021 and 202 0 , the Company had 3,874,999 and
5,709,999shares of Class A common stock options, respectively, that were
exercised via nonrecourse promissory notes, of which 1,740,313 and
4,935,000shares, were unvested and subject to repurchase, respectively. The
principal balances of nonrecourse promissory notes outstanding amounted to $
19.7 million and $ 21.2million as of March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

11. Net Income (Loss) Per Share                                             
Basic and diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to common
stockholders is computed in conformity with the two-class method required
for participating securities. The Company considers its convertible
preferred stock, options exercised in exchange for nonrecourse promissory
notes, early exercised unvested stock options and unvested restricted stock
awards to be participating securities. Under the two-class method, the net
loss attributable to common stockholders is not allocated to convertible
preferred stock, options exercised in exchange for nonrecourse promissory
notes, early exercised unvested common stock options and unvested restricted
stock awards as the holders of these instruments do not have a contractual
obligation to share in the Company’s losses. Net income is attributed to
common stockholders and participating securities based on their
participation rights. Basic net loss per share attributable to common
stockholders is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common
stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share attributable to
common stockholders adjusts basic earnings per share for the potentially
dilutive impact of stock options.

income (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders (in thousands,

The table above does not include the convertible security issued in 2020.   
This security is convertible into the Company’s common stock starting 61days
following the effective date of an initial public offering of the Company.  
The convertible security may be converted, at the option of the holder, into
a number of shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock equal to $         
40.0million divided by a conversion price equal to (i) the preceding        
20-dayvolume-weighted average trading price per share of Class A Common

The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in foreign
jurisdictions. The Company bases its interim tax accruals on an estimated
annual effective tax rate applied to year-to-dateincome and record the
discrete tax items in the period to which they relate. In each quarter, the
Company updates its estimated annual effective tax rate and makes a year-to-
dateadjustment to its tax provision as necessary. The Company’s calendar
year 2021 annual effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate
primarily due to stock compensation expense, foreign derived intangible
income deduction, and the foreign tax rate differential. For the three
months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded $ 3.2million of
income tax benefit and $ 2.9million of income tax expense, respectively.
On March 11, 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act (“ARPA”) was enacted. The
ARPA contains numerous income tax provisions, such as expanding the
definition of covered employees. The ARPA has no impact on the income tax
provision (benefit) for the three months ended March 31, 2021.
During the three months ended March 31, 2021, there were no material changes
to the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits, and the Company does not expect
material changes in its unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve
months.

The change from $ 2.9million of tax provision during the three months ended
March 31, 2020, to $ 3.2million of tax benefit during the three months ended
in March 31, 2021 was primarily due to a net loss before taxes compared to a
net income before taxes in the respective periods, and an establishment of
deferred tax liability related to restructuring during the three months
ended March 31, 2020.
13. Related Party On February 12, 2021, the Company entered into certain    
amendment to the Credit Agreement. See N ote 8. In connection with this     
amendment, the Company paid $ 0.8 million in fees to KKR Capital Markets    
LLC, who is affiliated with KKR Denali, one of the Company’s principal      
stockholders. On March 31, 2021, the Company drew down an additional $ 250.0
million from the Company’s $ 600.0 million revolving credit facility. A     
lender under the revolving credit facility is an affiliate of KKR Denali, a 
principal stockholder of the Company. See Note 8. 1 4. Subsequent Events In 
April 2021, the Company completed two separate transactions to acquire      
certain mobile game Apps from two foreign- based independent mobile game    
developers in exchange for an aggregate upfront cash consideratio nof $     
300.0 million and potential future earn-out payments. Concurrent with the   
closings of these transactions, the Company entered into a development      
services agreement with each of the independent mobile game developers to   
support the acquired mobile game Apps, as well as to develop new game Apps  
during the four-year term of the agreement. With respect to the first       
transaction, the potential future earn-out payments are contingent on the   
revenue generated by the acquired game Apps exceeding a certain revenue     
threshold, which will be measured and payable (if applicable) each year for 
four years from the date of the transaction. With respect to the second     
transaction, the potential future earn-out payments will be determined in a 
manner similar to the first transaction, in addition to a potential one-time
earn-out payment of $ 50.0million contingent on the achievement of a certain
monthly revenue milestone within the four years following the date of the   
transaction. Due to the timing of these transactions, as of the date of     
issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company  
is in the process of finalizing the valuation and related accounting for    
these transactions. In May 2021, the Company granted 6,038,514RSUs to       
certain employees under the 2021 Plan at the grant date fair value of $     
58.55per RSU. The RSUs generally vest either over fouror over five yearsof  
continuous service from their respective vesting commencement dates. In May 
2021, the Company amended a certain agreement with a cloud service provider 
to increase the aggregate spend commitment from $ 130.0million to $         
300.0million through May 2026. 2 3

  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND   
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial
 condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our 
condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing 
 elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Qand in our final prospectus 
 related to our initial public offering, or IPO, dated April 14, 2021. This 
   discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and    
 uncertainties. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences  
  include those identified below and those discussed in the section titled  
“Risk Factors” and other parts of this Form 10-Q. Our historical results are
   not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any   
    period in the future. Overview Our mission is to grow the mobile app    
  ecosystem by enabling the success of mobile app developers. Our software  
  solutions provide advanced tools for mobile app developers to grow their  
 businesses by automating and optimizing the marketing and monetization of  
their apps. Since inception, our platform has driven over six billion mobile
app installs for mobile app developers. Our software, coupled with our deep 
    industry knowledge and expertise, has allowed us to rapidly scale a     
  successful and diversified portfolio of owned mobile apps. We have also   
    accelerated our market penetration through an active acquisition and    
 partnership strategy. Our scaled and integrated business model sits at the 
   nexus of the mobile app ecosystem, which creates a durable competitive   
advantage that has fueled our clients’ success and our strong growth. Since 
  our founding in 2011, we have been focused on building a software-based   
platform for mobile app developers to improve the marketing and monetization
   of their apps. Our founders, who are mobile app developers themselves,   
quickly realized the real impediment to success and growth in the mobile app
  ecosystem was a discovery and monetization problem—breaking through the   
 congested app stores to efficiently find users and successfully grow their 
business. Their first-hand experience with these developer challenges led to
      the development of our infrastructure and software—AppLovin Core      
 Technologies and AppLovin Software Platform. We capitalized on our success 
and understanding of the mobile app ecosystem by launching AppLovin Apps in 
 2018. Our Apps now consist of a globally diversified portfolio of over 200 
  free-to-playmobile games across five genres, run by fourteen studios. 24

For the three months ended March 31, 2021, our revenue grew 132% year-over- 
year, from $260.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 to      
$603.9 million in the comparative period in 2021. We generated a net loss of
$10.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, and a net income of
$4.7 million in the comparative period in 2020. We generated Adjusted EBITDA
of $131.1 million, and $62.4 million for the three months ended March 31,   
2021 and 2020, respectively. Our strong cash flow generation has allowed us 
to reinvest in our expansion and growth and consummate strategic            
acquisitions and partnerships. See the section titled “Non-GAAPFinancial    
Measures” for a definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of       
Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most directly comparable financial
measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Our Business Model We collect   
revenue from two sources—business clients and consumers. During the three   
months ended March 31, 2021, Business Revenue represented 40.6% of total    
revenue and Consumer Revenue represented 59.4% of total revenue. Business   
Revenue We generate Business Revenue from fees paid by mobile app           
advertisers, or business clients, that use our Software Platform to grow and
monetize their apps. We also collect Business Revenue from business clients 
that purchase the digital advertising inventory of our portfolio of Apps. We
are able to grow our Business Revenue by improving our Software Platform,   
adding more apps to our Apps portfolio and increasing engagement on our     
existing Apps. Business clients include a wide variety of advertisers, from 
indie developer studios to some of the largest global internet platforms,   
such as Facebook and Google. While we have over 500 business clients as of  
March 31, 2021, the vast majority of our revenue is derived from our        
Enterprise Clients. See “Key Metrics” below for additional information on   
how we calculate Enterprise Clients. Approximately 99% of our Business      
Revenue for the twelve months ended March 31, 2021 came from our 194        
Enterprise Clients. Our Enterprise Clients had a Net Dollar-Based Retention 
Rate of approximately 130% for the twelve months ended March 31, 2021 1. We 
see multiple opportunities to gain new business clients, and to increase    
spend from existing business clients, as we help them grow their businesses 
and make them more successful. Business Revenue from our Apps was 64.0% of  
total Business Revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2021.            
                                                                            
     We measure Net Dollar-Based Retention Rate for the twelve months       
     ended March 31, 2021 for our Enterprise Clients as current period      
     revenue divided by prior period revenue. Prior period revenue is       
     measured as revenue for the twelve months ended March 31, 2020 from    
     our Enterprise Clients as of March 31, 2020. Current period revenue    
     is revenue for the twelve months ended March 31, 2021 from our         
     Enterprise Clients as of March 31, 2021, and excludes revenue from     
     any new Enterprise Clients during the twelve months ended March 31,    
  1  2021.

   Table of Contents Our Software Platform includes AppDiscovery and MAX.   
 Business clients use AppDiscovery to automate, optimize, and manage their  
user acquisition investments. They set marketing and user growth goals, and 
 AppDiscovery optimizes their ad spend in an effort to achieve their return 
 on advertising spend targets and other marketing objectives. AppDiscovery  
 comprises the vast majority of revenue from our Software Platform. Revenue 
 is generated from our advertisers, typically on a performance-based, cost- 
per-installbasis, and shared with our advertising publishers, typically on a
cost per impression model. Business clients use MAX to optimize purchases of
app ad inventory. The Compass Analytics tool within MAX provides insights to
manage against key performance indicators, understand the long-term value of
users, and help manage profitability. Revenue from MAX is generated based on
   a percentage of client spend. As more developers move to in-appbidding   
 monetization, we expect growth in the adoption of, and revenue from, MAX.  
Business clients that purchase advertising inventory from our Apps are able 
  to target highly relevant users from our diverse and global portfolio of  
 over 200 mobile games. Our clients leverage a broad set of high-performing 
 mobile ad formats, including playable and rewarded video, and are able to  
 match these ads with relevant users resulting in a better return on their  
 advertising spend. By increasing the number of users and their engagement, 
as well as better matching ads with the appropriate target audience, we are 
able to increase our revenue from business clients that purchase advertising
 inventory from our Apps. Revenue from business clients related to our Apps 
  is generated from ads purchased by advertisers, as well as from revenue-  
  sharing agreements between some of our studios and a selection of third-  
 party studios for which they publish and monetize games. Consumer Revenue  
 Consumer Revenue is generated when a user of one of our Apps makes an in-  
   apppurchase (IAP). Our Apps are generally free-to-playmobile games and   
 generate Consumer Revenue through IAPs. IAPs consist of virtual goods used 
 to enhance gameplay, accelerate access to certain features or levels, and  
augment other mobile game progression opportunities for the user. IAPs drive
more engagement and better economics from our Apps. The vast majority of our
 IAP revenue flows through two app stores, Apple App Store and Google Play, 
which charge us a standard commission on IAPs. During the three months ended
   March 31, 2021, we had an average of 3.1 million Monthly Active Payers   
  (MAPs) across our portfolio of Apps. Over that period, we had an Average  
Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP) of $38. Leveraging the benefit of 
  our integrated Platform and Apps, we see opportunities to grow our App-   
   relatedrevenue streams by increasing MAPs and expanding ARPMAP within    
     existing games and through new game development, acquisitions and      
 partnerships. See “Key Metrics” below for additional information on how we 
              calculate MAPs and ARPMAP. 26 Table of Contents               
Key Metrics We review the following key metrics on a regular basis in order 
to evaluate the health of our business, identify trends affecting our       
performance, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions.   
Annual Key Metrics Enterprise Cli e nt s .We focus on the number of         
Enterprise Clients, which are third-party business clients from whom we have
collected greater than $125,000 of revenue in the trailing 12 months to a   
given date. Enterprise Clients generate the vast majority of our Business   
Revenue and Business Revenue growth. We expect to increase the revenue from 
Enterprise Clients over time. R e v e n u e P e r Ent e r p r i se Client   
(RPEC).We define RPEC as (i) the total revenue derived from our Enterprise  
Clients in a twelve- month period, divided by (ii) Enterprise Clients as of 
the end of that same period. RPEC shows how efficiently we are monetizing   
each Enterprise Client. We expect to increase RPEC over time as we enhance  
our Software Platform and Apps. The following table shows our Enterprise    
Clients as of March 31, 2021 and 2020, and our RPEC for the twelve months

number of Software Platform Enterprise Clients, which are third-party       
business clients from whom we have collected greater than $31,250 of        
Software Platform revenue in the three months to a given date, equating to  
an annual run-rate of $125,000 in revenue. Software Platform Enterprise

Monthly Active Payers (MAPs).We define a MAP as a unique mobile device      
active on one of our Apps in a month that completed at least one IAP during 
that time period. A consumer who makes IAPs within two separate Apps on the 
same mobile device in a monthly period will be counted as two MAPs. MAPs for
a particular time period longer than one month are the average MAPs for each
month during that period. We estimate the number of MAPs by aggregating     
certain data from third-party attribution partners. Some of our Apps do not 
utilize such third-party attribution partners, and therefore our MAPs figure
for any period does not capture every user that completed an IAP on our     
Apps. We estimate that our counted MAPs generated approximately 96% of our  
Consumer Revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2021, and as such, 
management believes that MAPs are still a useful metric to measure the      
engagement and monetization potential of our games. We expect to increase   
our MAPs over time as we increase the number of our Apps and enhance the    
engagement and monetization of our Apps. Av e rage R e venue P e r Monthly  
Active Pa y e r (ARPM A P).We define ARPMAP as (i) the total Consumer       
Revenue derived from our Apps in a monthly period, divided by (ii) MAPs in  
that same period. ARPMAP for a particular time period longer than one month 
is the average ARPMAP for each month during that period. ARPMAP shows how   
efficiently we are monetizing each MAP. We expect to increase ARPMAP over   
time as we enhance the monetization of our Apps. The following table shows  
our Monthly Active Payers and Average Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer for

Platform revenue is from third-party clients using our software platform to 
find new customers. We do not recognize revenue from our own spend on our   
software platform. Therefore, we use TSTV to measure the scale and growth   
rates of our software platform, as it reflects the total value on our       
software platform including our first-party studios as though they were     
stand-alone businesses. The following table shows our Total Software        
Transaction Value for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020.

Our key metrics are not based on any standardized industry methodology and  
are not necessarily calculated in the same manner or comparable to similarly
titled measures presented by other companies. Similarly, our key metrics may
differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled   
metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology. The numbers   
that we use to calculate TSTV, MAP, and ARPMAP are based on internal data.  
While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable judgments 
and estimates for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent  
challenges in measuring usage and engagement. We regularly review and may   
adjust our processes for calculating our internal metrics to improve their  
accuracy. 27

Non-GAAPFinancial Metrics Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin We     
define Adjusted EBITDA for a particular period as net income (loss) before  
interest expense and loss on settlement of debt, other (income) expense,    
net, provision for (benefit from) income taxes, amortization, depreciation  
and write-offs and as further adjusted for stock-based compensation expense,
acquisition-related expense, loss (gain) on extinguishments of acquisition  
related continent consideration, nonoperating foreign exchange losses, lease
modification and abandonment of leasehold improvements, and change in the   
fair value of contingent consideration. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as 
Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the same period. Adjusted EBITDA and 
Adjusted EBITDA margin are key measures we use to assess our financial      
performance and are also used for internal planning and forecasting         
purposes. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are helpful 
to investors, analysts, and other interested parties because they can assist
in providing a more consistent and comparable overview of our operations    
across our historical financial periods. In addition, these measures are    
frequently used by analysts, investors, and other interested parties to     
evaluate and assess performance. We use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 
margin in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment  
of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget
and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business      
strategies, and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our   
financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are non-  
GAAPfinancial measures and are presented for supplemental informational     
purposes only and should not be considered as alternatives or substitutes to
financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures have
certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain       
expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations that
are necessary to run our business. Our definitions may differ from the      
definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be      
limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar      
metrics. Furthermore, these metrics have certain limitations in that they do
not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our        
consolidated statement of operations that are necessary to run our business.
Thus, our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin should be considered in
addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared
in accordance with GAAP. The following table provides our Adjusted EBITDA   
and Adjusted EBITDA margin for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and    
2020, and a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA:

Factors Affecting Our Performance We believe that the future success of our 
business depends on many factors, including the factors described below.    
While each of these factors presents significant opportunities for our      
business, they also pose important challenges that we must successfully     
address in order to continue to grow profitably while maintaining strong    
cash flow. Continue to invest in innovation We have made, and intend to     
continue to make, significant investments in our Core Technologies and      
Software Platform to enhance their effectiveness and value proposition for  
our business clients. We expect that these investments will require spending
on research and development, and acquisitions and partnerships related to   
technology components and products. We believe investments in our Core      
Technologies, such as our launch of AXON and acquisition of MAX, will       
further improve their effectiveness for developers. Our investments will    
also allow us to enter new mobile app sectors outside of gaming. While our  
investments in research and development and acquisitions and partnerships   
may not result in revenue in the near term, we believe these investments    
position us to increase our revenue over time. 28

   Retain and grow existing business clients                                
                                                                            
We rely on existing business clients for a significant portion of our
revenue. As we improve our Software Platform and Apps, we can attract
additional spend from these business clients. Our business clients include
indie studio developers and some of the largest mobile advertising platforms
in the world. We believe there is significant room for us to further expand
our relationships with these clients and increase their usage of our
Software Platform. We have invested in targeted sales and account-based
marketing efforts to identify and showcase opportunities to business clients
and plan to continue to do so in the future.

In the past, our business clients have generally increased their usage of
our Software Platform and Apps, and as a result, growth from existing
business clients has been a primary driver of our revenue growth. We must
continue to retain our existing business clients and expand their spend with
us over time to continue to grow our revenue, increase profitability and
drive greater cash flow.
                                                                            
   Add new business clients globally                                        
                                                                            
Our future success depends in part on our ability to acquire new business
clients. We recently increased our focus on markets outside the United
States to serve the needs of business clients globally. During the three
months ended March 31, 2021, only 42% of our revenue from business clients
was generated from outside of the United States. We believe that the global
opportunity is significant and will continue to expand as developers and
advertisers outside the United States adopt our Software Platform and
advertise on our Apps. We also see opportunities to acquire new business
clients outside of mobile gaming, as the capabilities of our Core
Technologies and Software Platform are relevant to the broader mobile app
ecosystem. We are investing in direct sales, product development, education,
and other capabilities to drive increased awareness and adoption of our
Software Platform and Apps, which investments may impact our profitability
in the near term as we seek further scale. We must continue to acquire new
business clients to grow our revenue, increase profitability, and drive
greater cash flow.
Optimization, growth, and expansion of our AppLovin Apps                    
We plan to continue to invest in developing new Apps and enhancing existing
Apps. Because our Apps are typically free to download and use, economically
acquiring users and monetizing through advertising and IAPs is critical to
the future success of our Apps. We plan to launch several new Apps per year,
as well as continue to make investments by acquiring and partnering with
studios in mobile gaming and other mobile app sectors.

Given our expertise in app marketing, we are able to pursue a highly-
optimized and scaled user acquisition investment playbook. During the three
months ended March 31, 2021, we invested $265.5 million in sales and
marketing, a large percentage of which was invested in user acquisition to
grow the number of users engaging with our Apps. We believe the scale,
insights, and effective monetization strategies provided through our
Software Platform and integrated business model allow us to optimize ad
spend across our portfolio of Apps. We also invest in the growth of our Apps
by improving in-game monetization, optimizing game economies and in-game
conversion, and opt-in business services, such as creative services and
localization. We must continue to optimize, grow, and expand our Apps
portfolio to grow our revenue, increase profitability, and drive greater
cash flow.
Continued execution of strategic acquisitions and partnerships              
We intend to continue to make strategic acquisitions and enter into
strategic partnerships to grow our portfolio of Apps and add complementary
software and tools to our Core Technologies. Since the beginning of 2018, we
have invested over $2 billion in 18 strategic acquisitions and partnerships
with mobile app developers and for technologies to enhance our Core
Technologies including the acquisition of Adjust GmbH, which closed in April
2021. We have been very successful in growing mobile apps that we have added
to our Apps portfolio. We have also invested strategically to enhance our
Core Technologies. For example, in 2018 we acquired MAX, an in-app bidding
platform, which improves monetization on apps.
                                     29                                     
                                                                            
  Table of Contents                                                         
                                                                            
While we have a strong pipeline of strategic acquisition and partnership
opportunities, we believe our future results of operations will be affected
by our ability to continue to identify and execute such transactions that
are accretive to our growth and profitability.
                                                                            
  Growth and structure of the mobile app ecosystem                          
                                                                            
Our business and results of operations will be impacted by industry factors
that drive overall performance of the mobile app ecosystem. The mobile app
ecosystem has grown rapidly in recent years. We expect that any
acceleration, or slowing, of this growth would affect our business and
results of operations. In addition, even if the mobile app ecosystem
continues to grow at its current rate, our ability to position ourselves
within the market will impact our business and results of operations.

Mobile app developers, including AppLovin, rely on third-party platforms,
such as the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, among others, to
distribute games, collect payments made for IAPs, and target users with
relevant advertising. We expect this to continue for the foreseeable future.
These third-party platforms have significant market power and discretion to
set platform fees, select which apps to promote, and decide how much
consumer information to provide to advertising networks that enable our
Software Platform to target users with personalized and relevant advertising
and allocate marketing campaigns in an efficient and cost-effective manner.
Any changes made in the policies of third-party platforms could drive rapid
change across the mobile app ecosystem. For example, in June 2020, Apple
announced a plan to overhaul IDFA, which anonymously profiles users for
targeted advertising, as part of a new application tracking transparency
framework which began being rolled out in late April 2021 and, among other
things, requires opt-in consent for certain types of tracking. We rely in
part on IDFA to provide us with data that helps our Software Platform better
market and monetize Apps and to the extent we are unable to utilize IDFA or
a similar offering, our Software Platform may not be as effective, and we
may not be able to continue to efficiently generate revenue for our Apps.

New tools for developers, industry standards, and platforms may emerge in
the future. We believe our focus on the mobile app ecosystem has allowed us
to understand the needs of our business clients and our relentless
innovation has enabled us to quickly adapt to changes in the industry and
pioneer new solutions. We must continue to innovate and stay ahead of
developments in the mobile app ecosystem in order for our business to
succeed and our results of operations to continue to improve.
                                                                            
  Acquisition of Adjust                                                     
                                                                            
On April 20, 2021, we completed our acquisition of Adjust GmbH (“Adjust”), a
leading mobile app attribution, measurement and analytics company in
Germany, in exchange for (i) $598.0 million in cash, subject to certain
purchase price adjustments; (ii) convertible securities that automatically
convert into an aggregate number of shares of our Class A common stock
determined by dividing $352.0 million by the volume-weighted average trading
price per share of our Class A common stock over any 10 consecutive full
trading day period (chosen by the stockholder representative under the share
purchase agreement) within 20 trading days commencing with and following
April 15, 2021; and (iii) the assumption of up to $40.0 million in the
aggregate of debt, accrued interest, and fees of Adjust, in each case upon
the terms and subject to the conditions of the share purchase agreement.

The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting social distancing and shelter-in-place
orders put in place around the world have caused widespread disruption in
global economies, productivity, and financial markets and have altered the
way in which we conduct our day-to-day business. As a result of the COVID-19
pandemic we have temporarily closed our offices around the world, including
our corporate headquarters in Palo Alto, California, and implemented travel
restrictions. Our Software Platform and Apps do not require physical
interaction, thus, our ability to meet the needs of our clients and users
has not been materially affected. The full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
on the global economy and the extent to which the pandemic may impact our
business, financial condition, and results of operations in the future
remains uncertain. See the section titled “Risk Factors—The COVID-19
pandemic and responses thereto across the globe have altered how individuals
interact with each other and affected how we and our business partners are
operating, and the extent to which this situation will impact our future
results of operations remains uncertain” for additional information.

We collect Business Revenue from advertisers spending on our Software
Platform and Apps. Business Revenue from our Software Platform is generated
from our advertisers, typically on a performance-based, cost-per-install
basis, then shared with our advertising publishers, typically on a cost per
impression model. Business Revenue generated from our Apps comes from
advertisers that purchase ad inventory from our diverse portfolio of Apps.
Business Revenue from our Apps was 64% of total Business Revenue for the
three months ended March 31, 2021.

We generate Consumer Revenue from IAPs made by users within our Apps.

Cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of third-party payment
processing fees for distribution partners, amortization of acquired
technology related intangible assets, and expenses associated with operating
our network infrastructure. Third-party payment processing fees relate to
Consumer Revenue. The fees for IAPs are processed and collected by third-
party distribution partners. Network operating costs include bandwidth,
energy, other equipment costs related to our co-located data centers and
costs for third-party cloud service providers. We expect our cost of revenue
to increase in absolute dollars over the long term as our business and
revenue continue to grow. We also expect our cost of revenue as a percentage
of revenue to fluctuate period-over-period.

Sales and marketing . Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of user
acquisition costs, other advertising expenses, personnel-related expenses
for salaries, employee benefits, and stock-based compensation for employees
engaged in sales and marketing, and amortization of acquired user-related
intangible assets, marketing programs, travel, customer service costs, and
allocated facilities and information technology costs.

We plan to continue to invest in sales and marketing to grow our customer
base and increase brand awareness. As a result, we expect sales and
marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars. We also expect our sales
and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue to fluctuate period-over-
period in the near term as we invest to grow our customer base and increase
brand awareness, and to decrease over the long term as we benefit from
greater scale.

Research and development. Research and development expenses consist
primarily of product development costs, including personnel-related expenses
for salaries, employee benefits, and stock-based compensation for employees
engaged in research and development, professional services costs related to
development of new apps by third parties, consulting costs, regulatory
compliance costs, and allocated facilities and information technology costs.

We plan to continue to invest in research and development to continue to
enhance our Core Technologies and Software Platform, and to improve existing
games and develop new games. As a result, we expect research and development
expenses to increase in absolute dollars. We also expect our research and
development expenses as a percentage of revenue to fluctuate period-over-
period in the near term as we invest to enhance our Core Technologies and
Software Platform and improve our existing Apps and develop new Apps, and to
decrease over the long term as we benefit from greater scale.

General and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist
primarily of costs incurred to support our business, including personnel-
related expenses for salaries, employee benefits, and stock-based
compensation for employees engaged in finance, accounting, legal, human
resources and administration, professional services fees for legal,
accounting, recruiting, and administrative services (including acquisition-
related expenses), insurance, travel, and allocated facilities and
information technology costs.

We plan to continue to invest in our general and administrative function to 
support the growth of our business. In addition, following the completion of
this offering, we expect to incur additional general and administrative     
expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including expenses   
related to compliance and reporting obligations of a public company,        
increased insurance and investor relations expenses, and increased          
professional services fees (including acquisition-related expenses). As a   
result, we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in        
absolute dollars. We also expect our general and administrative expenses as 
a percentage of revenue to fluctuate period-over-period in the near term as 
we invest to support the growth of our business, and to decrease over the   
long term as we benefit from greater scale. Interest expense and loss on    
settlement of debt.Interest expense and loss on settlement of debt consists 
primarily of loss related to debt extinguishment, interest expense          
associated with our outstanding debt, including accretion of debt discount, 
and changes in fair value of interest rate swap accounted for as a cash flow
hedge related to the stream of variable interest payments associated with a 
portion of our outstanding debt. Other income, net.Other income, net,       
includes interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents, gains and losses 
related to embedded derivatives and other financial instruments accounted   
for at fair value, and foreign currency exchange gains (losses), which      
consist primarily of remeasurement of transactions and monetary assets and  
liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency at 
the end of the period. Provision for (benefit from) income taxes.We are     
subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions in   
which we do business. These foreign jurisdictions have different statutory  
tax rates than those in the United States. Additionally, certain of our     
foreign earnings may also be taxable in the United States. Accordingly, our 
effective tax rate will vary depending on the relative proportion of foreign
to domestic income, impacts from acquisition restructuring, deduction       
benefits related to foreign-derived intangible income, future changes in the
valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax    
laws. Additionally, our effective tax rate can vary based on the amount of  
pre-taxincome or loss. Results of Operations The following table summarizes

Total revenue increased by $343.7 million, or 132%, for the three months    
ended March 31, 2021 compared to the prior year period due to increases in  
Business Revenue – Software Platform of 90%, Business Revenue – Apps of 57% 
and Consumer Revenue of 215%. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, our
Business Revenue increased by $99.1 million from the prior year period. For 
the three months ended March 31, 2021, our Business Revenue from our        
Software Platform increased by $41.9 million from the prior year period     
primarily due to a 74% increase in installations while price per            
installation remained consistent with the prior year period. The increase in
our Business Revenue from Apps of $57.2 million was primarily a result of   
increased advertising revenue from acquired Apps which contributed $33.2    
million of the increase while our existing Apps and new Apps developed by   
our Owned and Partner Studios contributed the remaining increase. Usage of  
advertising inventory by our Owned Studios and Partner Studios represented  
24% of installations during the three months ended March 31, 2021. We do not
recognize Business Revenue from transactions with our Owned Studios and     
Partner Studios. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, our Consumer    
Revenue increased by $244.6 million from the prior year period, primarily   
due to a 175% increase in the volume of in-apppurchases, as well as a 14%   
increase in price per in-apppurchase. Newly developed Apps contributed      
$131.5 million of the increase, while Apps acquired since March 31, 2020    
generated $79.8 million of the increase, with the remaining increase from   
our existing Apps. Cost of revenue

Cost of revenue increased by $146.6 million, or 192%, for the three months  
ended March 31, 2021 compared to the prior year period. The increase was    
primarily due to a $72.9 million increase in third-party payment processing 
fees as a result of the growth in Consumer Revenue, a $54.6 million increase
in amortization of acquired-technology driven by an increase in acquisition 
activity, and a $13.5 million increase in expenses associated with operating
our network infrastructure driven by the growth in our operations. 34

General and administrative expenses increased by $32.2 million, or 297%, for

Other income, net increased by $8.8 million, or 859%, for the three months

term loan embedded derivative, and an unrealized gain of $5.4 million       
related to marketable equity securities, which were partially offset by a

The change from $2.9 million of tax provision during the three months ended 
March 31, 2020, to $3.2 million of tax benefit during the three months ended
in March 31, 2021 was primarily due to a net loss before taxes compared to a
net income before taxes in the respective periods, and an establishment of  
deferred tax liability related to restructuring during the three months     
ended March 31, 2020. Liquidity and Capital Resources Since inception, we   
financed our operations primarily through payments received from business   
clients using our Software Platform and advertising on our Apps, and from   
user IAPs from our Apps, and through net proceeds we received from the sales
of our convertible preferred stock and borrowings made under our Credit     
Agreement. As of March 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $761.1 
million. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents would be    
sufficient to satisfy our anticipated working capital and capital           
expenditures needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital      
requirements, however, will depend on many factors, including our growth    
rate; expansion of sales and marketing activities; timing and extent of     
spending to support our research and development efforts; capital           
expenditures to purchase hardware and software; and our continued need to   
invest in our IT infrastructure to support our growth. In addition, we may  
enter into additional strategic partnerships as well as agreements to       
acquire or invest in teams and technologies, including intellectual property
rights, which could increase our cash requirements. As a result of these and
other factors, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt         
financing sooner than we currently anticipate. For example, during the three
months ended March 31, 2021, we received net debt proceeds, which increased 
our cash balance as of March 31, 2021 by $542.4 million. If additional      
financing from outside sources is required, we may not be able to raise it  
on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In particular, the recent             
COVID-19pandemic has caused a disruption in the global financial markets,   
which may reduce our ability to access capital and negatively affect our    
liquidity in the future. If we are unable to raise additional capital when  
required, or if we cannot expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on  
our business opportunities because we lack sufficient capital, our business,
financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
On April 19, 2021, we completed our initial public offering, in which we    
sold 22,500,000 shares of Class A common stock at price to the public of    
$80.00 per share. We received aggregate net proceeds of $1.75 billion after 
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $47.2 million and       
offering expenses of $7.9 million subject to certain cost reimbursements. 36

Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $61.8    
million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, primarily consisting of a
$10.6 million of net loss, adjusted for certain non-cashitems, which        
included $88.8 million of amortization, depreciation and write-offs, $30.0  
million of stock-based compensation expense, $16.9 million of loss on       
settlement of debt, $11.2 million of net unrealized gains on fair value     
remeasurement of financial instruments, $4.3 million of amortization of debt
issuance costs and discount, and $5.8 million of change in operating right  
of use asset partially offset by a $60.8 million of cash consumed by working
capital. The increase in cash consumed by working capital was primarily     
driven by an increase in accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other    
assets and decrease in operating lease liabilities partially offset by      
higher accounts payable. Net cash provided by operating activities was $45.7
million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, primarily consisting of  
$4.7 million of net income, adjusted for certain non-cashitems, which       
included $32.3 million of depreciation and amortization expense, $3.5       
million of stock-based compensation expense, $1.4 million of amortization of
debt issuance costs and discount, $1.2 million of change in operating right 
of use asset and a $2.7 million decrease in cash consumed by working        
capital. The decrease in cash consumed by working capital was primarily     
driven by an increase in accounts payable and decrease in prepaid expenses  
and other current assets partially offset by higher accounts receivable and 
lower other non-currentliabilities. Investing Activities Net cash used in   
investing activities was $18.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 
2021, consisting of $4.2 million related to acquisitions, and $14.0 million 
in purchases of non-marketableinvestments and other. Net cash used in       
investing activities was $54.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 
2020, primarily related to acquisitions. Financing Activities Net cash      
provided by financing activities was $400.4 million for the three months    
ended March 31, 2021, primarily consisting of $844.7 million of proceeds    
from debt issuance and $12.9 million proceeds from exercise of stock awards 
partially offset by $302.3 million of principal repayment of debt and $152.2
million of payment of deferred acquisition costs. Net cash provided by      
financing activities was $33.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 
2020, primarily consisting of $49.8 million of proceeds from debt issuance  
partially offset by $11.0 million of payment of deferred acquisition costs  
and $3.1 million of principal repayment of debt. Credit Agreement On August 
15, 2018, we entered into a Credit Agreement which provided for senior      
secured term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $820.0 million (the  
“Closing Term Loans”) and a revolving credit facility of $50.0 million. On  
April 23, 2019, the Credit Agreement was amended to increase the senior     
secured term loan facility by $400.0 million, on terms identical to those   
applicable to the Closing Term Loans (together with the Closing Term Loans, 
the “Initial Term Loans”). On April 27, 2020, the Credit Agreement was      
further amended to modify certain negative covenants. On May 6, 2020, the   
Credit Agreement was further amended (the “Third Amendment”) to increase the
senior secured term loan facility by an additional $300.0 million (the      
“Third Amendment Term Loans”). On October 27, 2020, the Credit Agreement was
further amended to increase the aggregate principal amount of the revolving 
credit facility by an additional $540.0 million. On November 30, 2020, we   
borrowed $150.0 million under the revolving credit facility. 37             
                                                                            
  Table of Contents                                                         
                                                                            
In February 2021, we amended the credit agreement to 1) increase the senior
secured term loan facility by an aggregate principal amount of
$597.8 million (the “Fifth Amendment Term Loans”, and together with the
Initial Term Loans, the “Term Loans”), on terms identical to those
applicable to the existing Initial Term Loans, the proceeds of which was
partially used to repay in full the outstanding principal and accrued and
unpaid interest of the Third Amendment Term Loans, totaling $298.2 million,
in accordance with the pre-existing early redemption option in the credit
agreement, and 2) increase the aggregate principal amount of the revolving
credit facility by an additional $10.0 million, on terms identical to those
applicable to the existing revolving credit facility. In connection with
this amendment, we paid $0.8 million in fees to KKR Capital Markets LLC, who
is affiliated with one of the Company’s principal stockholders. On March 31,
2021, we drew down an additional $250.0 million from the Company’s
$600.0 million revolving credit facility. A lender under the revolving
credit facility is an affiliate of KKR Denali, a principal stockholder of
the Company. Following such draw down we had an aggregate amount of
$400.0 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility, which was
repaid in full with the net proceeds from the IPO in April 2021. See Note 8,
Credit Agreement, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial
statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for
additional information.

As of March 31, 2021, our total outstanding indebtedness under the credit
agreement was $2.19 billion, consisting of $1.79 billion of outstanding term
loans and $400.0 million of outstanding under the revolving credit facility.
                                                                            
  Contractual Obligations                                                   
                                                                            
In April 2021, we completed two separate transactions to acquire certain
mobile game Apps from two foreign-based independent mobile game developers
in exchange for an aggregate upfront cash consideration of $300.0 million
and potential future earnout payments. With respect to the first
transaction, the potential future earn-out payments are contingent on the
revenue generated by the acquired game Apps exceeding a certain revenue
threshold, which will be measured and payable (if applicable) each year for
four years from the date of the transaction. With respect to the second
transaction, the potential future earn-out payments will be determined in a
manner similar to the first transaction, in addition to a potential one-time
earn-out payment of $50.0 million contingent on the achievement of a certain
monthly revenue milestone within the four years following the date of the
transaction. Because these contingent consideration arrangements are based
on the success of relevant Apps and are not guaranteed, we do not expect our
results of operations would be materially and adversely affected by the
payment of amounts under such arrangements.

In May 2021, we amended a certain agreement with a cloud service provider to
increase the aggregate spend commitment from $130.0 million to $300.0
million through May 2026.

With the exception of the transactions described above and except for
scheduled payments from the ongoing business, there were no material changes
in our commitments under contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 as
disclosed in our final prospectus relating to our initial public offering
dated April 14, 2020.
                                                                            
  Off-BalanceSheet Arrangements                                             
                                                                            
As of March 31, 2021, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements
that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our
financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenue, or
expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital
resources that are material to investors.
                                                                            
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates                                
                                                                            
Our condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance
with GAAP. The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial
statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as
the reported revenue generated and expenses incurred during the reporting
periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various
other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the
results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying
value of assets and liabilities and the amount of revenue and expenses that
are not readily apparent from other sources. On an ongoing basis, we
evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from
these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and
estimates during the three months ended March 31, 2021, as compared to those
disclosed in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations set forth in our final prospectus filed with the
SEC on April 7, 2021 (our “Prospectus”) pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“Securities Act”).

We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business, which
primarily relate to fluctuations in interest rates.

As of March 31, 2021, we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of
$761.1 million. A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates would not have a
material impact on our financial condition or results of operations due to
the short-term nature of our cash equivalents.

As of March 31, 2021, we had a debt balance of $2.19 billion. A hypothetical
50 basis point change in interest rates as of March 31, 2021 would not have
a material impact on our net income for the three months ended March 31,
2021.

   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures                         
                                                                            
Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the
Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer have concluded that, as of such date, our
disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance
level.
                                                                            
  Changes in Internal Control                                               
                                                                            
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
identified in management’s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or
15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the period covered by this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
                                                                            
   Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures                  
                                                                            
Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures
or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and
all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can
provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect
the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls
must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent
limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide
absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any,
have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that
judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur
because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be
circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or
more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any
system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the
likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design
will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may
deteriorate. Due to inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system,
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

  Table of Contents                                                         
                                                                            
PART II – OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS From time to time, we 
may be subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary   
course of business, as well as governmental and other regulatory            
investigations and proceedings. In addition, third parties may from time to 
time assert claims against us in the form of letters and other              
communications. We are not currently a party to any legal proceedings that, 
if determined adversely to us, would, in our opinion, have a material       
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, 
or cash flows. Future litigation may be necessary to defend ourselves and   
our business partners and to determine the scope, enforceability, and       
validity of third-party proprietary rights, or to establish our proprietary 
rights. The results of any current or future litigation cannot be predicted 
with certainty, and regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an       
adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of  
management resources, and other factors. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS You should   
carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together    
with all of the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form          
10-Q,including our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and
the related notes and the section titled “Management’s Discussion and       
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Our business,   
financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could also be      
adversely affected by risks and uncertainties that are not presently known  
to us or that we currently believe are not material. If any of the risks    
actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations,   
and prospects could be adversely affected. In that event, the market price  
of our Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of
your investment. Risk Factor Summary Investing in our Class A common stock  
involves a high degree of risk because our business is subject to numerous  
risks and uncertainties, as fully described below. The principal factors and
uncertainties that make investing in our Class A common stock risky include,
among other things:                                                         
                                                                            
       We have a limited operating history, especially with respect to our  
  •    AppLovin Apps, which makes it difficult to evaluate our current      
       business and future performance and the risks we may encounter.      
                                                                            
                                                                            
       Our results of operations are likely to fluctuate                    
  •    fromperiod-to-period,which could cause the market price of our       
       Class A common stock to decline.                                     
                                                                            
                                                                            
       The mobile app ecosystem is intensely competitive. If business       
  •    clients or users prefer our competitors’ products or services over   
       our own, our business, financial condition, and results of           
       operations could be adversely affected.                              
                                                                            
                                                                            
       The mobile app ecosystem is subject to rapid technological change,   
       and if we do not adapt to, and appropriately allocate our resources  
  •    among, emerging technologies and business models, our business,

Risks Related to Our Business and Industry We have a limited operating      
history, especially with respect to our AppLovin Apps, which makes it       
difficult to evaluate our current business and future performance and the   
risks we may encounter. Our limited operating history, especially with      
respect to our AppLovin Apps, which we launched in 2018, may make it        
difficult to evaluate our current business and our future performance. We   
have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties      
frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries, 
such as the mobile app ecosystem, including our ability to:

  •    adapt to rapidly evolving trends in the ways businesses and          
       consumers interact with technology;                                  
                                                                            
                                             
  •    effectively manage our rapid growth;  
                                             
                                                                            
  •    avoid interruptions or disruptions in our AppLovin Core              
       Technologies, Software Platform, or Apps; and

Further, because we have limited historical financial data, including       
limited data regarding the integration of our strategic acquisitions and    
partnerships, and operate in a rapidly evolving market, any financial       
planning and forecasting, including predictions about our future revenue and
expenses, may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer        
operating history or operated in a more predictable market. If our          
assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan   
and operate our business, are incorrect or change, or if we do not address  
these risks successfully, our results of operations could differ materially 
from our expectations. If we fail to address the risks and uncertainties    
that we face, including those described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors”    
section, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could 
be adversely affected. Our results of operations are likely to fluctuate    
from period-to-period, whichcould cause the market price of our Class A     
common stock to decline. Our results of operations have fluctuated in the   
past and are likely to fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and  
year-to-year inthe future for a variety of reasons, many of which are       
outside of our control and difficult to predict. As a result, you should not
rely upon our historical results of operations as indicators of future      
performance. Numerous factors can influence our results of operations,      
including:

In particular, it is difficult to predict if, when, or how quickly newly-   
launched software may begin to generate revenue or decline in popularity.   
Further, we cannot be certain if a new App will become popular amongst users
and generate revenue. The success of our business depends in part on our    
ability to develop and enhance our Software Platform and consistently and   
timely launch new Apps. It is difficult for us to predict with certainty    
when we will expand our Software Platform suite or launch a new App as we   
may require longer development schedules or soft launch periods to meet our 
quality standards and expectations. If our business clients do not adopt our
new Software Platform offerings, or develop or further invest in their own  
competing alternatives, or if we are unable to successfully launch or       
acquire new Apps or maintain or improve existing Apps, our business and     
results of operations could be adversely affected. Fluctuations in our      
results of operations may cause such results to fall below our financial    
guidance or the expectations of analysts or investors, which could cause the
market price of our Class A common stock to decline. The mobile app         
ecosystem is intensely competitive. If business clients or users prefer our 
competitors’ products or services over our own, our business, financial     
condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. We face   
significant competition in the mobile app ecosystem. We offer a suite of    
solutions for developers to get their mobile apps discovered and downloaded 
by the right users, optimize return on marketing spend, and maximize the    
monetization of their engagement. We collect revenue from business clients  
for fees paid by mobile app advertisers, including developers, that use our 
Software Platform and from the sale of advertising inventory of our Apps.   
Advertisers often engage with several advertising platforms and 42          
                                                                            
  Table of Contents                                                         
                                                                            
networks to purchase advertisements on mobile apps and developers often
engage with multiple tools to market and monetize their apps. Accordingly,
we face significant competition from traditional, online and mobile
businesses that provide ad networks and platforms, mobile apps and games,
media, and other services for advertisers to reach relevant audiences. We
also face competition from providers of developer tools that enable
developers to reach their audiences or manage or optimize their advertising
campaigns. These companies vary in size and include Facebook, Google,
Twitter, and Unity Software as well as various private companies. Several of
these companies, including Facebook, Google, and Unity Software, are also
our partners and Enterprise Clients. Additionally, our studios build many of
our Apps using the development kits offered by Unity Software. Clients who
are also competitors may decide to invest in their own offerings rather than
continue to use our Software Platform or advertise on our Apps.

Additionally, we also compete with businesses that develop online and mobile
games and other mobile apps, which vary in size and include companies such
as Activision Blizzard, Tencent, and Zynga, as well as other public and
private companies. Many of these companies are also our partners and
clients. As we expand our global operations and mobile app offerings, we
increasingly face competition from high-profile companies with significant
online presences that may introduce new or expanded offerings, such as
Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Snap. In addition, other large
companies that to date have not actively focused on mobile apps or gaming
may decide to develop mobile apps or gaming offerings, such as Amazon’s
recently introduced games platform, or partner with other developers. Some
of these current and potential competitors have significantly greater
resources that can be used to develop, acquire, or brand additional mobile
apps or gaming alternatives, and may have more diversified revenue sources
than we do and therefore may be less severely affected by changes in
consumer preferences, regulations, or other developments that may impact our
business or industry.

Further, as there are relatively low barriers to entry to develop and
publish a mobile app, we expect new competitors to enter the market and
existing competitors to allocate more resources towards developing and
marketing competing games and apps. Because our mobile games are free to
play, our Apps compete primarily on the basis of user experience rather than
price. The proliferation of apps makes it difficult for us to differentiate
ourselves from our competitors and compete for users and the success of our
Apps will depend in part on our Software Platform continuing to provide
effective marketing and monetization tools.

We also face competition for advertising spending and for the discretionary
spending, leisure time, and attention of our users from game platforms such
as personal computer and console games, and other leisure time activities,
such as television, movies, music, sports, and the internet. In addition,
non-game applications for mobile devices, such as social media and
messaging, television, movies, music, dating, and sports, have become
increasingly popular, making the overall mobile app ecosystem highly
fragmented and making it more difficult for any mobile app to differentiate
itself. Our future growth depends in part on the overall health of the
mobile app ecosystem and in particular, mobile gaming. Increasing
competition could result in decreases in our App users, increased user
acquisition costs, lower engagement with our Apps, and loss of key
personnel, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial
condition, or results of operations.

Some of our current and potential competitors may be domiciled in different
countries and subject to political, legal, and regulatory regimes that
enable them to compete more effectively than us, particularly outside of the
United States. Some of our current and potential competitors may have
greater resources, more diversified revenue streams, better technological or
data analytics capabilities, or stronger brands or competitive positions in
certain product segments, geographic regions, or user demographics than we
do. If business clients or users prefer our competitors’ products or
services over our own, or if our competitors are better able to adapt to
changes in the preferences of advertisers or users, regulations, or other
developments, our business, financial condition, and results of operations
could be adversely affected.
The mobile app ecosystem is subject to rapid technological change, and if we
do not adapt to, and appropriately allocate our resources among, emerging   
technologies and business models, our business, financial condition, and    
results of operations could be adversely affected.                          
Technology changes rapidly in the mobile app ecosystem. Our future success
depends in part on our ability to adapt to trends and to innovate. To
attract new business clients and users and increase revenue from our current
business clients and users, we will need to enhance and improve our Core
Technologies, Software Platform, and Apps. Enhancements of our existing
technology and offerings, and new offerings, may not be introduced in a
timely or cost-effective manner and may contain errors or defects.

Our business also currently depends in part on the growth and evolution of
the internet, especially mobile internet-enabled devices. The number of
people using mobile internet-enabled devices has increased rapidly over
time, and we expect that this trend will continue. However, the mobile app
ecosystem may not grow in the way we anticipate. We must continually
anticipate and adapt to emerging technologies to stay competitive. As the
technological infrastructure for internet access improves and evolves,
consumers will be presented with more opportunities to access apps and play
games on a variety of devices and platforms and to experience other leisure
activities that may compete with mobile apps. Forecasting the financial
impact of these emerging technologies and business models is inherently
uncertain and volatile. If we decide to support a new technology or business
model in the future, it may require partnering with a new platform,
technology, or business partner, which may be on terms that are less
favorable to us than those for traditional technologies or business models.

To invest in a new technology or expand our offerings, we must invest       
financial resources and management attention. We may invest significant     
resources in a new offering or in a strategic acquisition or partnership,   
which could prove unsuccessful or prevent us from directing these resources 
towards other opportunities. We may never recover the often-substantial up- 
front costsof developing and marketing emerging technologies or business    
models, or recover the opportunity cost of diverting management and         
financial resources. Further, our competitors may adopt an emerging         
technology or business model more quickly or effectively than we do,        
creating products that are technologically superior to ours or attract more 
users than ours. If, on the other hand, we do not continue to enhance our   
Core Technologies, Software Platform, or Apps, or do not appropriately      
allocate our resources amongst opportunities, or we otherwise elect not to  
pursue new business models that achieve significant commercial success, we  
may face adverse consequences. For example, we do not currently offer our   
Apps on all devices or all gaming platforms. If the devices on which our    
Apps are available decline in popularity or become obsolete faster than     
anticipated, or if new platforms emerge other than those on which our games 
are offered, we could experience a decline in revenue and in our number of  
App users, and we may not achieve the anticipated return on our development 
efforts. It may take significant time and expenditures to shift product     
development resources to new technologies, and it may be more difficult to  
compete against existing products incorporating such technologies. If new   
technologies render mobile devices obsolete or we are unable to successfully
adapt to and appropriately allocate our resources amongst current and new   
technologies, our business, financial condition, and results of operations  
could be adversely affected. The failure to attract new business clients,   
the loss of clients, or a reduction in spending by these clients could      
adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of          
operations. A significant portion of our revenue is Business Revenue. We    
collect Business Revenue from advertisers spending on our Software Platform 
and Apps. Business Revenue from our Software Platform, which is mostly from 
AppDiscovery, is generated from our advertisers, typically on a performance-
based, cost-per-install basis,then shared with our advertising publishers,  
typically on a cost per impression model. Business Revenue generated from   
our Apps comes from advertisers that purchase ad inventory from our diverse 
portfolio of mobile games. As is common in the mobile app ecosystem and in  
the advertising industry, our business clients do not have long-term        
advertising commitments with us. Our success depends in part on our ability 
to satisfy our advertising partners. Business Revenue could also be impacted
by a number of other factors, including:

From time to time, certain of these factors have adversely affected our     
revenue to varying degrees. The occurrence of any of these or other factors 
in the future could result in a reduction in demand for our Software        
Platform and use of our Apps, which may reduce the prices we receive for our
advertisements or cause business clients to stop advertising with us        
altogether, either of which would adversely affect our business and results 
of operations. The failure to attract new business clients, loss of business
clients, or reduction in spending by business clients could adversely affect
our business, financial condition, and results of operations. If we are     
unable to launch or acquire new Apps and successfully monetize them, or     
continue to improve the experience and monetization of our existing Apps,   
our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be       
adversely affected. Our business depends in part on launching or acquiring, 
and continuing to service, mobile apps that users will download and spend   
time and money using. We have devoted and we expect to continue to devote   
substantial resources to the research, development, analytics, and marketing
of our Apps. Our development and marketing efforts are focused on improving 
the experience of our existing Apps, developing new Apps, and successfully  
monetizing our Apps. Our Apps generate revenue primarily through the sale of
advertising, a substantial portion of which comes from other mobile gaming  
clients, and in-apppurchases (IAPs). For Apps distributed through third-    
party platforms, we are required to share a portion of the proceeds from in-
game saleswith the platform providers, which share may be subject to changes
or increases over time. In order to achieve and maintain our profitability, 
we need to generate sufficient revenue from our existing and new Apps to    
offset our ongoing development, marketing, and other operating expenses.    
Successfully monetizing our Apps is difficult and requires that we deliver  
user experiences that a sufficient number of users will pay for through IAPs
or we are able to otherwise sufficiently monetize our Apps, including by    
serving in-app advertising.The success of our Apps depends in part on       
unpredictable and volatile factors beyond our control including user        
preferences, competing apps, new third-party platforms, and the availability
of other entertainment experiences. If our Apps do not meet user            
expectations or if they are not brought to market in a timely and effective 
manner, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
In addition, our ability to successfully launch or acquire Apps and their   
ability to achieve commercial success will depend in part on our ability to:

These and other uncertainties make it difficult to know whether we will     
succeed in continuing to develop and launch new Apps. Even if successful,   
certain genres of mobile apps, such as casual games, may have a relatively  
short lifespan. Further, as our Apps expand into additional genres of mobile
games or additional categories of mobile apps, we will face risks specific  
to those genres or categories. For example, in mid-core games,there is      
typically a higher upfront investment prior to the launch of a game compared
to casual games, which means publishing a new game in that genre will expose
us to greater risks as our financial condition and results of operations    
will be more significantly adversely affected to the extent such a game does
not become popular and commercially successful. If we are not successful in 
launching new mobile games or expanding into other genres of mobile games or
categories of mobile apps, our business, financial condition, and results of
operations could be adversely affected. If we fail to retain existing users 
or add new users cost-effectively, or if our users decrease their level of  
engagement with Apps, our business, financial condition, and results of     
operations could be adversely affected. The size of our user base and the   
level of user engagement with our Apps are critical to our success. Our     
results of operations have been and will continue to be significantly       
determined by our success in acquiring and engaging App users. We expect    
that the number of our App users may fluctuate or decline in one or more    
markets from time to time, particularly in markets where we have achieved   
higher penetration rates. In addition, if people do not perceive our Apps as
useful or entertaining, we may not be able to attract or retain users or    
otherwise maintain or increase the frequency and duration of their          
engagement, which could harm our revenue. A number of mobile apps that      
achieved early popularity have since seen their user bases or user          
engagement levels decline. There is no guarantee that we will not experience
a similar erosion of our App users or user engagement levels. Our user      
engagement patterns have changed over time, and user engagement can be      
difficult to measure, particularly as we introduce new and different Apps.  
Any number of factors can adversely affect user growth and engagement,      
including if:                                                               
                                                                            
  •    users increasingly engage with mobile apps offered by competitors    
       or mobile apps in categories other than those of our Apps;           
                                                                            
                                                                            
       we fail to introduce new Apps or features that users find engaging   
  •    or that achieve a high level of market acceptance or we introduce    
       new Apps, or make changes to existing Apps that are not favorably    
       received;

  •    we are unable to continue to develop Apps that work with a variety   
       of mobile operating systems and networks; and                        
                                                                            
                                                                            
       questions about the quality of our Apps, our data practices or       
  •    concerns related to privacy and sharing of personal information and  
       other user data, safety, security, or other factors.                 
                                                                            
Additionally, we expect it will become increasingly difficult and more      
expensive for us to acquire users for our Apps for a variety of reasons,    
including the increasingly competitive nature of the mobile app ecosystem   
and the significant amount of time and attention users are dedicating to    
competing entertainment options. Further, we believe that changes that Apple
has implemented during the last several years to its platform, particularly 
the removal of the Top Grossing rankings and decreasing the prominence of   
the Top Free rankings, may adversely affect the number of organic downloads 
of our Apps. If our competitors increase their user acquisition spending, we
could experience higher costs per an install for our Apps, which would      
adversely affect our revenue and margins. Furthermore, our spending on user 
acquisition is based on certain assumptions about their projected behavior, 
particularly for new Apps for which we do not have similar Apps in our      
portfolio to aid us in our modeling efforts. If we are unable to grow our   
user base and increase our user engagement levels, or unable to do so cost  
effectively, our business, financial condition, and results of operations   
could be adversely affected. We have experienced significant growth through 
strategic acquisitions and partnerships, and we face risks related to the   
integration of such acquisitions and the management of such growth. 46

As part of our growth strategy, we have frequently acquired companies,      
businesses, personnel, and technologies in the past, and we intend to       
continue to evaluate and pursue strategic acquisitions and partnerships. For
example, since 2018, we have invested over $2 billion across more than 18   
strategic acquisitions and partnerships, including for the acquisition of   
PeopleFun, Inc. in the first quarter of 2018, MAX Advertising Systems, Inc. 
in the third quarter of 2018, SafeDK Mobile Ltd. in July 2019, Machine Zone,
Inc. (Machine Zone) in May 2020, and adjust GmbH (Adjust) in April 2021.    
Each of these acquisitions requires unique approaches to integration due to,
among other reasons, the structure of the acquisitions, the size, locations,
and cultural differences among their teams and ours, and has required, and  
will continue to require, attention from our management team. As we continue
to grow, the size of our acquisitions and investments may increase. For     
instance, our acquisitions of Machine Zone and Adjust were our largest      
acquisitions to date. In addition to the larger purchase prices associated  
with such acquisitions and investments, larger acquisitions and investments 
may also require additional management resources to integrate more          
significant and often more complex businesses into our company. We will     
continue to explore and evaluate additional acquisitions, some of which may 
be the same size or even larger in scale and investment than the Machine    
Zone and Adjust acquisitions. Our future success depends in part on our     
ability to integrate these acquisitions and manage these businesses,        
partnerships, and transactions effectively. If we are unable to obtain the  
anticipated benefits or synergies of such acquisitions, or we encounter     
difficulties integrating acquired businesses with ours, our business,       
financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
Challenges and risks from such strategic acquisitions and partnerships      
include:

       integration;

If we are unable to successfully integrate and manage our acquisitions and  
strategic partnerships, we may not realize the expected benefits of such    
transactions or become exposed to additional liabilities, and our business, 
financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.

We plan to continue to expand and diversify our operations through strategic
acquisitions and partnerships. We face a number of risks related to these   
transactions.                                                               
We plan to continue to expand and diversify our operations with additional
strategic acquisitions or partnerships, strategic collaborations, joint
ventures, or licensing arrangements. As we continue to grow, these
transactions may be larger and require significant investments, such as our
acquisitions of Machine Zone and Adjust. We may be unable to identify or
complete prospective acquisitions or partnerships for many reasons,
including our ability to identify suitable targets, increasing competition
from other potential acquirers, the effects of consolidation in our
industries, potentially high valuations of acquisition candidates, and the
availability of financing to complete larger acquisitions. Even if we do
complete any such transactions, we may incur significant costs, such as
professional service fees. In addition, applicable antitrust laws and other
regulations may limit our ability to acquire targets, particularly larger
targets, or force us to divest an acquired business. If we are unable to
identify suitable targets or complete acquisitions, our growth prospects
could be adversely affected, and we may not be able to realize sufficient
scale and technological advantages to compete effectively in all markets.

Further, completing larger acquisitions or other strategic transactions is
significantly riskier in that such transactions require additional
consideration and management attention to complete, and could introduce
additional exposure to regulatory and compliance risk. To complete these
transactions, we may need to spend large amounts of cash, which may not be
available to us on acceptable terms, if at all, or issue equity or equity-
linked consideration, which may dilute our current stockholders. For
example, in connection with our acquisition of Adjust in April 2021, we
issued convertible securities that will automatically convert into an
aggregate number of shares of our Class A common stock determined by
dividing $352.0 million by the volume-weighted average trading price per
share of our Class A common stock over any 10 consecutive full trading day
period (chosen by the stockholder representative under the share purchase
agreement) within 20 trading days commencing with and following April 15,
2021. Further, we generally devote more time and resources towards
performing diligence on larger transactions and may be required to devote
more resources towards regulatory requirements in connection with such
transactions. To the extent that we do not perform sufficient diligence on a
larger acquisition or such a transaction does not generate the expected
benefits, our business, financial condition, and results of operations will
be harmed, and to a greater extent than would occur with a smaller
transaction.

Absent such strategic transactions, we would need to undertake additional
development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect
to fund and undertake such additional efforts on our own, we may need to
obtain additional expertise and additional capital, which may not be
available to our company on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to
do any of the foregoing, we may not be able to develop our Core
Technologies, Software Platform, and Apps effectively or achieve our
expected product roadmap on a timely basis, which could adversely affect our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.

The benefits of a strategic acquisition or partnership may also take
considerable time to develop, and we cannot be certain that any particular
strategic acquisition or partnership will produce the intended benefits.
Further, acquisitions could result in potential dilutive issuances of equity
securities, use of significant cash balances or incurrence of debt (and
increased interest expense), contingent liabilities or amortization expenses
related to intangible assets, or write-offs of goodwill and intangible
assets. If we are unable to identify and complete strategic acquisitions or
partnerships, our business, financial condition, and results of operations
could be adversely affected.
Our strategic acquisitions and partnerships may expose us to tax risks.     
From time to time, we have acquired and may acquire companies, assets,
businesses, and technologies and we have entered into and may enter into
other strategic partnerships and transactions. We face a variety of tax
risks related to such transactions, including that we may be required to
make tax withholdings in various jurisdictions in connection with such
transactions or as part of our continuing operations following a
transaction, and that the companies or businesses we acquire may cause us to
alter our international tax structure or otherwise create more complexity
with respect to tax matters. Additionally, while we typically include
indemnification provisions in our definitive agreements related to strategic
acquisitions and partnerships, these indemnification provisions may be
insufficient in the event that tax liabilities are greater than expected or
in areas that are not fully covered by indemnification. If we are unable to
adequately predict and address such tax issues as they arise, our business,
financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.
We have entered into strategic partnerships with mobile gaming studios, and 
a failure to maintain such relationships may harm our ability to launch new 
Apps as well as our brand and reputation.                                   
From time to time, we have entered into strategic partnerships with mobile
gaming studios (our Partner Studios). We have historically allowed these
Partner Studios to continue their operations with a degree of autonomy. In
certain of these transactions, we have bought games from such Partner
Studios and entered into development agreements whereby such Partner Studios
provide us support in developing and improving games and grant us a right of
first refusal with respect to future games. These agreements typically have
a fixed term, after which our Partner Studios may choose not to continue
working with us. Any deterioration in
                                     48                                     
                                                                            
  Table of Contents                                                         
                                                                            
our relationship with these Partner Studios may harm our ability to monetize
the games we purchase and launch future mobile games developed by these
Partner Studios and may lead to such Partner Studios choosing not to renew
their partnerships with us. Further, if a Partner Studio becomes
dissatisfied with us, our brand and reputation may be harmed and we may have
more difficulty entering into similar partnerships in the future.
Additionally, our international Partner Studios may be located in areas with
less certain legal and regulatory regimes or more potential risks, which may
increase our costs to maintain such strategic partnership. If we are unable
to maintain any of these partnerships, we may be required to invest
significant resources in expanding our other studios or entering into
agreements with additional mobile gaming studios in order to continue
producing the same volume and quality of Apps, and our business, financial
condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.
We rely on third-party platforms to distribute our Apps and collect revenue,
and if our ability to do so is harmed, or such third-party platforms change 
their policies in such a way that restricts our business, increases our     
expenses, or limits the information we derive from our Apps, our business,  
financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
The mobile app ecosystem depends in part on a relatively small number of
third-party distribution platforms, such as the Apple App Store, the Google
Play Store, and Facebook, some of which are direct competitors. We derive
significant revenue from the distribution of our Apps through these third-
party platforms and almost all of our IAPs are made through the payment
processing systems of these third-party platforms. We are subject to the
standard policies and terms of service of such third-party platforms, which
generally govern the promotion, distribution, content, and operation of
applications on such platforms. Each platform provider has broad discretion
to change and interpret its terms of service and other policies with respect
to us and other mobile app companies, and those changes may be unfavorable
to us. A platform provider may also change its fee structure, add fees
associated with access to and use of its platform, alter how mobile apps are
labeled or are able to advertise on its platform, change how the personal
information of its users is made available to developers on its platform,
limit the use of personal information for advertising purposes, restrict how
users can share information on its platform or across platforms, or
significantly increase the level of compliance or requirements necessary to
use its platform. For example, in June 2020, Apple announced a plan to
overhaul IDFA, which anonymously profiles users for targeted advertising, as
part of a new proposed application tracking transparency framework that,
among other things, would require opt-in consent for certain types of
tracking. The extent of such potential IDFA and transparency changes, and
their timing, remains uncertain. We rely in part on IDFA to provide us with
data that helps our Software Platform better market and monetize Apps. The
proposed IDFA and transparency changes may require us to engage in
significant changes to our data collection practices, which may require our
expenditure of substantial costs and resources, and to the extent we are
unable to utilize IDFA or a similar offering, or if the transparency changes
and any related opt-in or other requirements result in decreases in the
availability or utility of data relating to Apps, our Software Platform may
not be as effective, we may not be able to continue to efficiently generate
revenue for our Apps, and our revenue and results of operations may be
harmed. Additionally, Apple implemented new requirements for consumer
disclosures regarding privacy and data processing practices in December
2020, which has resulted in increased compliance requirements and could
result in decreased usage of our Apps. Apple has also announced a new
application tracking transparency framework that would require opt-in
consent for certain types of tracking. This transparency framework, which
began being rolled out in late April 2021, could have an impact on the
effectiveness of our advertising practices and/or our ability to efficiently
generate revenue for our Apps. These or any similar changes to the policies
of Apple or Google may materially and adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.

If we violate, or a distribution platform provider believes we have
violated, a distribution platform’s terms of service, or if there is any
change or deterioration in our relationship with such distribution provider,
that platform provider could limit or discontinue our access to its
platform. For example, in August 2020, Apple and Google removed a mobile
game developed by one of our competitors from their platforms for violating
their standard policies and terms of service. If one of our distribution
platform partners were to limit or discontinue the distribution of our Apps
on their platform, it could adversely affect our business, financial
condition, and results of operations.

We also rely on the continued popularity, user adoption, and functionality
of third-party platforms. In the past, some of these platform providers have
been unavailable for short periods of time or experienced issues with their
in-app purchasing functionality. In addition, third-party platforms also
impose certain file size limitations, which may limit the ability of users
to download some of our larger Apps in over-the-air updates. Aside from
these over-the-air file size limitations, a larger game file size could
cause users to delete our mobile games once the file size grows beyond the
capacity of their devices’ storage limitations or could reduce the number of
downloads of these mobile games.

If issues arise with third-party platforms that impact the visibility or
availability of our Apps, our users’ ability to access our Apps or our
ability to monetize our Apps, or otherwise impact the design or
effectiveness of our Software Platform, our business, financial condition,
and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Our revenue has been concentrated in various ways and the loss of, or a     
significant reduction in, any such revenue source, or our failure to        
successfully expand and diversify our revenue sources could adversely affect
our business, financial condition, and results of operations.               
We have historically experienced revenue concentration with respect to
certain Apps as well as other facets of our business. Our future success
depends, in part, on launching or acquiring and successfully monetizing
additional Apps and on establishing and maintaining successful relationships
with a diverse set of business clients. While our Apps consist of over 200
mobile games, currently a limited number of those are responsible for a
significant portion of our revenue. I n the twelve months ended March 31,
2021, tw o games, Matchington Mansion and Wordscapes, collectively
represented approximately 25% of our revenue. The loss or failure to
successfully monetize one of these Apps could have a significant impact on
our results of operations. Similarly, our future success depends, in part,
on the ability of our Owned Studios and Partner Studios to launch and
monetize additional mobile games and other mobile apps, as well as, on our
ability to successfully acquire and monetize additional mobile games and
other mobile apps, and these Apps may not successfully diversify our revenue
concentration. If we are unable to successfully launch or acquire new Apps,
our reliance on a limited number of Apps may increase. Additionally, certain
genres of games typically rely on only a small portion of their total users
for a significant amount of their revenue, and as we expand our number of
Apps in these genres, such as mid-core, we may experience these effects and
need to attract, engage, and increase the spending levels of these
particular users to achieve success.

More generally, we face concentration risk in that our Software Platform and
Apps operate in the mobile app ecosystem and specifically mobile gaming. As
such, our business depends, in part, on the continued health and growth of
these app ecosystems. Further, a significant amount of our total revenue is
derived through a limited number of third-party distribution platforms, such
as the Apple App Store, the Google Play Store, and Facebook. Because
Facebook and Google are also significant partners of Adjust, a deterioration
in our or Adjust’s relationship with such companies would have a greater
impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. If
any of these concentrated portions of our revenue are harmed or are lost,
our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be
adversely affected.
We have experienced recent rapid growth, which may not be indicative of our 
future growth. We may be unable to effectively manage the growth of our     
business, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition,   
and results of operations.                                                  
We have experienced rapid growth in the scale, scope, and complexity of our
business. For example, while we only launched our Apps in 2018, today, our
Apps consist of a globally diversified portfolio of over 200 free-to-play
mobile games across five genres, run by fourteen studios. Our growth in any
prior period should not be relied upon as an indication of our future
performance, as we may not be able to sustain our growth rate in the future.
Even if our revenue continues to increase, we expect that our revenue growth
rate may decline in the future as a result of a variety of factors,
including because of more difficult comparisons to prior periods and the
saturation of the market. The overall growth of our revenue depends in part
on our ability to execute on our growth strategies.

Additionally, the growth and expansion of our business has placed and
continues to place a significant strain on our management, operations,
financial infrastructure, and corporate culture. Our future success depends
in part on our ability to manage this expanded business and to continue to
grow both our Software Platform and Apps. If not managed effectively, this
growth could result in the over-extension of our management systems and
information technology systems and our internal controls and procedures may
not be adequate to support this growth. Failure to adequately manage our
growth in any of these ways may cause damage to our brand and reputation and
adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.
Our future growth may involve expansion into new business opportunities, and
any efforts to do so that are unsuccessful or are not cost-effective could  
adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of          
operations.                                                                 
In the past, we have grown by expanding our offerings into new business
opportunities and we expect to continue to do so. We have dedicated
resources to expanding into adjacent business opportunities in which large
competitors have an established presence, as was the case with our Apps.
Additionally, our future growth may include expansion into additional genres
of mobile games or into other mobile app sectors, which may require
significant investment in order to launch and which may not be prove
successful. Our future growth depends in part on our ability to correctly
identify areas of investment and to cost-effectively execute on our plans.
We have in the past and may in the future expend significant resources in
connection with strategic acquisitions and partnerships to expand into new
business opportunities. Even if successful, the growth of any new business
opportunity could create significant challenges for our management and
operational resources and could require considerable investment. The
deployment of significant resources towards a new opportunity that proves
unsuccessful, or our inability to choose the correct investment
opportunities for our future, could adversely affect our business, financial
condition, and results of operations.

Our international operations are subject to increased challenges and risks. 
We expect to continue to expand our international operations in the future  
by opening new offices, entering into strategic partnerships with new       
international game studios, acquiring companies that may have international 
operations, and providing our Apps in additional countries and languages.   
For example, our studios that we own (Owned Studios) and others that we     
partner with (Partner Studios) are located throughout the world, including  
in areas with less certain legal and regulatory regimes or more potential   
risks, such as China and Vietnam. Expanding our international operations may
subject us to risks associated with:

Our ability to successfully gain market acceptance in any particular        
international market is uncertain and, in the past, we have experienced     
difficulties and have not been successful in all the countries we have      
entered. If we are unable to continue to expand internationally or manage   
the complexity of our global operations successfully, our business,         
financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
Our business depends in part on our ability to increase in-app              
purchases,manage the economies in our Apps and respond to changes with      
respect to in-app purchases,and any failure to do so could adversely affect 
our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our business  
and future growth depend in part on our ability to increase the amount of   
IAPs in our Apps, which requires our studios to effectively design mobile   
games and other apps that create features and virtual goods for which users 
will pay. Users make IAPs because of the perceived in-appvalue of virtual   
goods, which is dependent on the relative ease of obtaining an equivalent   
good by playing our mobile games. The perceived in-appvalue of these virtual
goods can be impacted by various 51                                         
                                                                            
  Table of Contents                                                         
                                                                            
actions that we take in the mobile games including offering discounts for
virtual goods, giving away virtual goods in promotions, or providing easier
non-paid means to secure these goods. Managing virtual economies is
difficult and relies on our assumptions and judgement. Further, changes in
user preferences, including with respect to how they interact with mobile
apps and general views towards IAPs, could decrease levels of spending on
IAPs on our Apps and in the mobile app ecosystem generally. If we fail to
manage our virtual economies properly or fail to promptly and successfully
respond to any disruption in such economies, our reputation may be harmed
and our users may be less likely to play our mobile games and to purchase
virtual goods from us in the future, which could adversely affect our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.

In addition, changes in the policies of Apple, Google, or other third-party
platforms, or changes in accounting policies promulgated by the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC), and national accounting standards bodies
affecting software and virtual goods revenue recognition, could further
significantly affect the way we report revenue related to IAPs, which could
adversely affect our results of operations. Any changes in user, third-party
platform, or regulator views towards IAPs, or any inability by us to respond
to changing trends with respect to IAPs, could adversely affect our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.
We are highly dependent on our co-founder andchief executive officer, as    
well as our senior management team, and our business and growth may be      
adversely affected if we fail to attract, retain, and motivate key          
personnel.                                                                  
Our future success depends in significant part on the continued service of
our key management and engineering personnel, including our co-founder, CEO,
and Chairperson, Adam Foroughi. Our ability to compete and grow depends in
part on the efforts and talents of these employees and executives, who are
important to our vision, strategic direction, culture, products, and
technology. We do not have employment agreements, other than offer letters,
with Mr. Foroughi or other members of our senior management team, and we do
not maintain key-man insurance for members of our senior management team.
The loss of Mr. Foroughi or any other member of our senior management team
could cause disruption and adversely affect our business, financial
condition, or results of operations.

In addition, our ability to execute our strategy depends in part on our
continued ability and the continued ability of our Partner Studios to
identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly skilled employees,
particularly in the competitive fields of game development, product
management, engineering, and data science. We believe that our corporate
culture has been an important factor in our ability to hire and retain key
employees, and if we are unable to maintain our corporate culture as we
grow, we may be unable to foster the innovation, creativity, and teamwork we
believe we need to support our growth. While we believe we compete
favorably, competition for highly skilled employees is intense, particularly
in the San Francisco Bay Area, where our headquarters is located.
Interviewing, hiring, and integrating new employees has been and will
continue to be particularly challenging during the COVID-19 pandemic. As
part of our global remote working plans, throughout the duration of the
COVID-19 pandemic, we will devote increased efforts to maintaining our
collaborative culture, including through the use of videoconferencing and
other online communication and sharing tools, and to monitoring the health,
safety, morale, and productivity of our employees, including new employees,
as we evaluate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and
employees. If we are unable to identify, hire, and retain highly skilled
employees, our business, financial condition, and results of operations
could be adversely affected.

We have historically hired a number of key personnel and added additional
team members working on our Apps through strategic acquisitions and
partnerships, and as competition within the mobile app ecosystem for
attractive target companies with a skilled employee base persists and
increases, we may incur significant expenses and difficulty in continuing
this practice. The loss of talented employees with experience in the assets
we acquire could result in significant disruptions to our business and the
integration of acquired assets and businesses. If we do not succeed in
recruiting, retaining, and motivating these key employees, we may not
achieve the anticipated results of acquisitions.
Security breaches, improper access to or disclosure of our data or user     
data, other hacking and phishing attacks on our systems, or other cyber     
incidents could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business.      
The mobile app ecosystem is prone to cyberattacks by third parties seeking
unauthorized access to our data or the data of our clients or users or to
disrupt our ability to provide service. Our Software Platform and Apps
involve the collection, storage, processing, and transmission of a large
amount of data, including personal information. We also store and implement
measures designed to secure the source code for our Software Platform and
Apps as they are created. Any failure to prevent or mitigate security
breaches and improper access to or disclosure of our data, including source
code, or user data, including personal information, content, or payment
information from users, or information from business clients, could result
in the unauthorized loss, modification, disclosure, destruction, or other
misuse of such data, which could adversely affect our business and
reputation, damage our operations, result in litigation or regulatory
enforcement action, and diminish our competitive position. In particular, a
breach, whether physical, electronic, or otherwise, of the systems on which
such source code and other sensitive data are stored could lead to damage or
piracy of our offerings, lost or reduced ability to protect our intellectual
property, and diminished competitive position.

Computer malware, viruses, social engineering (predominantly spear phishing
attacks or credential stuffing), and general hacking have become more
prevalent in the mobile app ecosystem. These have occurred on our systems
and otherwise in our business in the past, and we expect will continue to
occur in the future. We regularly encounter attempts to create false or
undesirable user accounts or take other actions for purposes such as
spamming or other objectionable ends. Such breaches and attacks may cause
interruptions to the services we provide, degrade the user experience, cause
clients or users to lose confidence and trust in our Software Platform or
Apps, impair our internal systems and other systems and networks used in our
business, or adversely affect our financial condition. Our efforts to
protect our data, user data, and information from clients and partners, and
to disable undesirable activities on our Software Platform or Apps, may also
be unsuccessful due to software bugs or other technical malfunctions;
employee, contractor, vendor, or partner error or malfeasance, including
defects or vulnerabilities in information technology systems or offerings;
breaches of physical security of our facilities or technical infrastructure;
or other threats that evolve.

In addition, some developers or other business partners, such as those that
help us measure the effectiveness of advertisements, may receive or store
information provided by us or by our users through mobile or web apps. We
provide limited information to such third parties based on the scope of
services provided to us. These third parties may misappropriate our
information and engage in unauthorized use of it. If these third parties
fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices, or experience a
breach of their networks, our data or our users’ data may be improperly
accessed, used, or disclosed. In such an event, we may have increased costs
arising from the restoration or implementation of additional security
measures which could adversely affect our business and results of
operations. Any theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade
secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an
event could also adversely affect our business, competitive position, and
results of operations.

Cyberattacks continue to evolve in sophistication and volume, and inherently
may be difficult to detect for long periods of time. Although we have
developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our data, user
data, and information from our partners; to prevent data loss, disable
undesirable accounts and activities on our Software Platform or Apps; and to
prevent and detect security breaches; we cannot assure you that such
measures will provide comprehensive security, that we will be able to
identify breaches or to react to them in a timely manner or that our
remediation efforts will be successful. We experience cyberattacks and other
security incidents of varying degrees from time to time, and we may incur
significant costs in investigating, protecting against, litigating, or
remediating such incidents. We may face increased risks of cyberattacks and
other security incidents during the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of more
employees working remotely, our use of third-party systems designed to
enable the transition to a remote workforce introducing security risks and
increased cyberattacks, such as phishing attacks by threat actors using the
attention placed on the COVID-19 pandemic as a method for targeting
personnel.

In addition to our efforts to mitigate cybersecurity risks, we are making
significant investments in privacy, safety, security, and content review
efforts to combat misuse of our services and user data by third parties. As
a result of these efforts, we anticipate that we will discover incidents of
misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties. We may
not discover all such incidents or activity, whether as a result of our data
limitations, the scale of activity on our Software Platform, challenges
related to our personnel working remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, the
re-allocation of resources to other projects, or other factors, and we may
be notified of such incidents or activity by users, the media, or other
third parties. Such incidents and activities have in the past, and may in
the future, include the use of user data or our systems in a manner
inconsistent with our terms, contracts or policies, the existence of false
or undesirable user accounts, improper advertising practices, activities
that threaten people’s safety on- or offline or instances of spamming,
scraping, data harvesting, or unsecured datasets. We may also be
unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our policies or otherwise remediate
any such incidents. Any of the foregoing developments could adversely affect
user trust and engagement, harm our brand and reputation, require us to
change our business practices, and adversely affect our business and results
of operations.

We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and
abroad relating to cybersecurity and data protection, a number of which also
provide a private right of action. Affected users or government authorities
could initiate legal or regulatory actions against us in connection with any
actual or perceived security breaches or improper access to or disclosure of
data, which has occurred in the past and which could cause us to incur
significant expense and liability, distract management and technical
personnel, and result in orders or consent decrees forcing us to modify our
business practices. Such incidents or our efforts to remediate such
incidents may also result in a decline in our active user base or engagement
levels. Any of these events could adversely affect our reputation, business,
financial condition, or results of operations.
We anticipate increasing our operating expenses in the future, and we may   
not be able to achieve or maintain our profitability in any given period. If
we cannot achieve or maintain our profitability, our business could be      
adversely affected.                                                         
Although we have been profitable on a GAAP basis and had positive cash flow
from operations in certain prior periods, we may not always achieve
sufficient revenue or manage our expenses in order to achieve positive cash
flow from operations or profitability in any given period. Our operating
expenses may continue to rise as we implement additional initiatives
designed to increase revenue, potentially including: developing our Software
Platform and technology stack, expanding our Software Platform, launching
Apps, strategic acquisitions and partnerships, business client and user
acquisition spending, international expansion, hiring additional
                                     53                                     
                                                                            
  Table of Contents                                                         
                                                                            
employees, and taking other steps to strengthen and grow our company. We are
likely to recognize costs associated with these investments earlier than
some of the anticipated benefits, and the return on these investments may be
lower, or may develop more slowly, than we expect. We also anticipate that
the costs of acquiring new business clients and mobile app users, and
otherwise marketing our Software Platform and Apps, will continue to rise.
Further, we may continue to incur significant costs in connection with
strategic acquisitions and partnerships, which costs may increase or become
more concentrated to the extent we enter into larger transactions. If we are
not able to maintain positive cash flow in the long term, we may require
additional financing, which may not be available on favorable terms or at
all, and which may be dilutive to our stockholders. If we are unable to
generate adequate revenue growth and manage our expenses, we may incur
significant losses in the future and may not be able to maintain positive
cash flow from operations or profitability.
Our Software Platform and Apps, as well as our internal systems, rely on    
software and hardware that is highly technical, and any errors, bugs, or    
vulnerabilities in these systems, or failures to address or mitigate        
technical limitations in our systems, could adversely affect our business,  
financial condition, and results of operations.                             
Our Software Platform and Apps, as well as our internal systems, rely on
software and hardware that is highly technical and complex. In addition, our
Software Platform and Apps, as well as our internal systems, depend in part
on the ability of such software and hardware to store, retrieve, process,
and manage immense amounts of data. The software and hardware on which we
rely has contained, and will in the future contain, errors, bugs, or
vulnerabilities and our systems are subject to certain technical limitations
that may compromise our ability to meet our objectives. Some errors, bugs,
or vulnerabilities inherently may be difficult to detect and may only be
discovered after the code has been released for external or internal use.
Errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, design defects, or technical limitations
within the software and hardware on which we rely have in the past led to,
and may in the future lead to, outcomes including a negative experience for
clients and users who use our offerings, compromised ability of our
offerings to perform in a manner consistent with our terms, contracts, or
policies, delayed product or App launches or enhancements, targeting,
measurement, or billing errors, compromised ability to protect the data of
our users and/or our intellectual property, or reductions in our ability to
provide some or all of our services. To the extent such errors, bugs,
vulnerabilities, or defects impact our Software Platform or the accuracy of
data in any such Software Platform, our clients may become dissatisfied with
our offerings, our brand and reputation may be harmed, and we may make
operational decisions, such as with respect to our Apps using such Software
Platform or any future strategic acquisition, that are based on inaccurate
data. Any errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, or defects in our systems or the
software and hardware on which we rely, failures to properly address or
mitigate the technical limitations in our systems, or associated
degradations or interruptions of service or failures to fulfill our
commitments to our clients may lead to outcomes including damage to our
reputation, increased product engineering expenses, regulatory inquiries,
litigation, or liability for fines, damages, or other remedies, any of which
could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.
Our business depends in part on our ability to maintain and scale our       
technical infrastructure, and any significant disruption to our Software    
Platform or Apps could damage our reputation, result in a potential loss of 
engagement, and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and     
results of operations.                                                      
Our reputation and ability to attract and retain our business clients and
users depends in part on the reliable performance of our Software Platform
and Apps. We have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience,
interruptions in the availability or performance of our offerings from time
to time. Our systems may not be adequately designed or may not operate with
the reliability and redundancy necessary to avoid performance delays or
outages that could be harmful to our business. If our offerings are
unavailable when users attempt to access them, or if they do not load as
quickly as expected, users may not use our offerings as often in the future,
or at all, which could adversely affect our business and results of
operations. As we continue to grow, we will need an increasing amount of
technical infrastructure, including network capacity and computing power, to
continue to satisfy our needs and the needs of our business clients and
users. It is possible that we may fail to continue to effectively scale and
grow our technical infrastructure to accommodate these increased demands,
which may adversely affect our user engagement and revenue growth.
Additionally, we rely in part on third-party data centers and cloud hosting
infrastructure. Our business may be subject to interruptions, delays, or
failures resulting from natural disasters and other events outside of our
control that impact us or these third-party providers. If such an event were
to occur, users may be subject to service disruptions or outages and we may
not be able to recover our technical infrastructure and user data in a
timely manner to restart or provide our services. If we fail to efficiently
scale and manage our infrastructure, or if events disrupt our infrastructure
or those of our third-party providers, our business, financial condition,
and results of operations could be adversely affected.
The COVID-19 pandemicand responses thereto across the globe have altered how
individuals interact with each other and affected how we and our business   
partners are operating, and the extent to which this situation will impact  
our future results of operations remains uncertain.                         
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and resulting social distancing and shelter-
in-place orders put in place around the world have caused widespread
disruption in global economies, productivity, and financial markets and have
altered the way in which we conduct our day-to-day business.
                                     54                                     
                                                                            
  Table of Contents                                                         
                                                                            
The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and the various responses
thereto impact our business, operations, and results of operations will
depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately
predict, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic, including any
potential future waves of the pandemic; governmental, business, and
individual actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to
the pandemic; the effect on our clients; disruptions or restrictions on our
employees’ ability to work and travel; the availability and cost to access
the capital markets; and interruptions related to our cloud networking and
mobile app infrastructure and that impact our business partners, platform
providers, clients, and customer service and support providers. As a result
of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have temporarily closed our offices around the
world, including our corporate headquarters in Palo Alto, California, and
implemented travel restrictions. While substantially all of our business
operations can be performed remotely, many of our employees are juggling
additional work-related and personal challenges. We will continue to
actively monitor the issues raised by the COVID-19 pandemic and may take
further actions that alter our business operations, including as may be
required by federal, state, local, or foreign authorities or that we
determine are in the best interests of our employees, users, business
partners, and stockholders.

In addition to the potential direct impacts to our business, the global
economy has been, and is likely to continue to be, significantly weakened as
a result of the actions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and
future government intervention remains uncertain. A weakened global economy
may negatively impact our business partners as well as our users’ in-app
purchasing decisions and users’ buying decisions across the globe generally,
which could adversely affect advertiser activity. We may experience
heightened levels of variability in the pricing of advertising both in terms
of user acquisition and as it relates to our Software Platform and Apps. If
these conditions result in significant decreased pricing of advertising, the
revenue we make from our Software Platform and advertisers paying to display
advertisements in our Apps could be adversely affected, particularly if the
levels of user engagement in our Apps are not sufficient to offset these
declines, and we may experience increased pressure on our overall margins.
If we are not able to respond to and manage the direct and indirect impact
of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, then our business, financial
condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.
Our company culture has contributed to our success and if we cannot maintain
this culture as we grow, our business could be harmed.                      
We believe that our company culture has been critical to our success and
will be important for our continued growth. We face a number of challenges
that may affect our ability to sustain our corporate culture, including:
failure to identify, attract, reward, and retain people in leadership
positions in our organization who share and further our culture and values;
the increasing size and geographic diversity of our workforce; competitive
pressures to move in directions that may divert us from our culture and
values; the continued challenges of a rapidly-evolving industry; the
increasing need to develop expertise in new areas of business that affect
us; a negative perception of our treatment of employees or our response to
employee sentiment related to political or social causes or actions of
management; and the integration of new personnel and businesses from
acquisitions. If we are not able to maintain our culture, we could lose the
innovation, passion, and dedication of our team and as a result, our
business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely
affected.
If we do not successfully or cost-effectively invest in, establish, and     
maintain awareness of the AppLovin brand, our business, financial condition,
and results of operations could be adversely affected.                      
We believe that establishing and maintaining the AppLovin brand is critical
to maintaining and creating favorable relationships with, and our ability to
attract, new business clients, particularly Enterprise Clients, and key
personnel. Increasing awareness of the AppLovin brand will depend largely
upon our marketing efforts and our ability to successfully differentiate our
Software Platform from the offerings of our competitors. In addition,
successfully globalizing and extending our brand requires significant
investment and extensive management time. If we fail to maintain and
increase brand awareness and recognition of our Software Platform, our
business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely
affected.
We generally do not have long-term agreements with our business clients.    
Our business clients are not required to enter into long-term agreements
with us and may choose to stop using our Software Platform at any time. For
example, our advertising agreements can be executed in as little as one day
and can be terminated for convenience on two days’ notice. In order to
continue to grow our Software Platform, we must consistently provide
offerings that clients see as valuable and choose to use. If we fail to
maintain our relationships with our clients, or if the terms of these
relationships become less favorable to us, our results of operations would
be harmed. Additionally, as certain of our Enterprise Clients are also our
competitors, these clients may choose to invest in their own offerings
rather than continue to use our Software Platform. Any failure to maintain
our relationships with business clients could adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.
If our Apps do not meet user expectations, or contain objectionable content,
our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations    
could be adversely affected.                                                
                                     55                                     
                                                                            
  Table of Contents                                                         
                                                                            
Expectations regarding the quality, performance, and integrity of our Apps
are high. We must continually adapt to changing user preferences including
the popularity of various game categories, style of play, and IAP options.
Users may be critical of our Apps, business models, or business practices
for a wide variety of reasons, including perceptions about gameplay,
fairness, game content, features, or services. Independent industry analysts
may publish reviews of our Apps from time to time, as well as those of our
competitors, and perception of our Apps in the marketplace may be
significantly influenced by these reviews. We have no control over what
users or these industry analysts report. If users and industry analysts
negatively respond to our Apps or changes that we make to our Apps, or
provide negative reviews of our Apps, our reputation, business, financial
condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Further, despite reasonable precautions, some users may be offended by
certain mobile app content, advertisements displayed in our Apps or by the
treatment of other users. For example, if users believe that an
advertisement displayed in an App contains objectionable content, we could
experience damage to our brand and reputation and users could refuse to play
such game and pressure platform providers to remove the App from their
platforms. While such content may violate our terms and we may subsequently
remove it, our brand and reputation may nonetheless be harmed and our
clients may become dissatisfied with our services. Furthermore, steps that
we may take in response to such instances, such as temporarily or
permanently shutting off access of a user to our Apps, could adversely
affect our business and results of operations. Any failure to meet user
expectations or provide our Apps without objectionable content could
adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, and results
of operations.
The proliferation of “cheating” programs and scam offers that seek to       
exploit our mobile games and users may adversely affect game-playing        
experiences and lead users to stop playing our mobile games. Our failure to 
maintain a customer support ecosystem may enhance these risks.              
Our users rely on our customer support organization to resolve any issues
relating to our mobile games. Customer support is important for satisfying
user expectations regarding the quality, performance, and integrity of our
mobile games. We currently have limited customer support operations, which
we recently acquired through Machine Zone. If we do not effectively train,
supplement, and manage our customer support organization to assist our
users, and if that support organization does not succeed in helping users
quickly resolve issues or provide effective ongoing support, we could
experience decreased user engagement and harm to our reputation with
potential new users.

Additionally, unrelated third parties have developed, and may continue to
develop, “cheating” programs that enable users to exploit vulnerabilities in
our mobile games, play them in an automated way, collude to alter the
intended game play, or obtain unfair advantages over other users who do play
fairly. These programs harm the experience of users who play fairly and may
disrupt the virtual economies of our mobile games and reduce the demand for
certain IAPs. In addition, unrelated third parties have attempted to scam
our users with fake offers for virtual goods or other game benefits. These
unauthorized or fraudulent transactions are usually arranged on third-party
websites and the virtual goods offered may have been obtained through
unauthorized means, such as exploiting vulnerabilities in our mobile games,
or may be fraudulent offers. We do not generate any revenue from these
transactions. These unauthorized purchases and sales from third-party
sellers have in the past and could in the future impede our revenue and
profit growth.

There can be no assurance that our customer support and other efforts to
detect, prevent, or minimize these unauthorized or fraudulent transactions
will be successful, that these actions will not increase over time or that
our customer support efforts will be successful in resolving user issues.
Any failure to maintain adequate customer support or success of third-party
cheating programs or scams may negatively affect game-playing experiences
and lead users to stop playing our mobile games, which could adversely
affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Our business is subject to economic, market, public health, and geopolitical
conditions as well as to natural disasters beyond our control.              
Our business is subject to economic, market, public health, and geopolitical
conditions, as well as natural disasters beyond our control. Our revenue is
driven in part by discretionary consumer spending habits and preferences,
and by advertising spending patterns. Historically, consumer purchasing and
advertising spending have each declined during economic downturns and
periods of uncertainty regarding future economic prospects or when
disposable income or consumer lending is lower. General macro-economic
conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown in the United States or
internationally, including those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and
geopolitical issues, could create uncertainty and adversely affect
discretionary consumer spending habits and preferences as well as
advertising spending. Uncertain economic conditions may also adversely
affect our business clients. As a result, we may be unable to continue to
grow in the event of future economic slowdowns. We are particularly
susceptible to market conditions and risks associated with the mobile app
ecosystem, which also include the popularity, price, and timing of our Apps,
changes in user demographics, the availability and popularity of other forms
of entertainment, and critical reviews and public tastes and preferences,
which may change rapidly and cannot necessarily be predicted.
                                     56                                     
                                                                            
  Table of Contents                                                         
                                                                            
Additionally, our principal offices are located in the San Francisco Bay
Area, an area known for earthquakes and susceptible to fires, and are thus
vulnerable to damage. All of our facilities are also vulnerable to damage
from natural or manmade disasters, including power loss, earthquakes, fires,
explosions, floods, communications failures, terrorist attacks, contagious
disease outbreak (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), and similar events. If any
disaster were to occur, our ability to operate our business at our
facilities could be impaired and we could incur significant losses, recovery
from which may require substantial time and expense.
                                                                            
  Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters                             
                                                                            
We are subject to laws and regulations concerning privacy, information      
security, data protection, consumer protection, advertising, tracking,      
targeting, and protection of minors, and these laws and regulations are     
continually evolving. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with these  
laws and regulations could adversely affect our business, financial         
condition, and results of operations.                                       
We receive, store, and process personal information and other user data, and
we enable our users to share their personal information with each other and
with third parties, including within our Apps. There are numerous federal,
state, and local laws around the world regarding privacy and the collection,
storing, sharing, use, processing, disclosure, deletion, and protection of
personal information and other user data, the scope of which are changing,
subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent between
countries or conflict with other rules.

Various government and consumer agencies have called for new regulation and
changes in industry practices and are continuing to review the need for
greater regulation for the collection of information concerning consumer
behavior on the internet, including regulation aimed at restricting certain
targeted advertising practices. For example, the GDPR, which became
effective in May 2018, created new individual privacy rights and imposed
worldwide obligations on companies processing personal data of European
Union users, which has created a greater compliance burden for us and other
companies with European users, and subjects violators to substantial
monetary penalties. The United Kingdom has implemented legislation that
substantially implements the GDPR and which also provides for substantial
monetary penalties. With regard to transfers to the United States of
personal data (as such term is used in the GDPR and applicable EU member
state legislation, and as similarly defined under the proposed ePrivacy
Regulation) from our employees and European users and other third parties,
we have relied upon the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield as well as
certain standard contractual clauses approved by the EU Commission (the
SCCs); however, both the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and the EU Model Clauses
have been subject to legal challenge, and on July 16, 2020, the Court of
Justice of the European Union, Europe’s highest court, held in the Schrems
II case that the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield was invalid, and imposed
additional obligations in connection with the use of the SCCs. EU regulators
since have issued additional guidance regarding these additional
requirements that we and other companies must consider and undertake when
using the SCCs. We are in the process of assessing this decision and related
guidance and their impact on our data transfer mechanisms. The SCCs and
other cross-border data transfer mechanisms may face additional legal
challenges or be the subject of additional legislative activity and
regulatory guidance. This decision imposes restrictions on the ability to
transfer personal data from the European Union and Switzerland to the United
States, and with the exit of the United Kingdom from the EU, we and other
companies face additional restrictions on transfers of personal data from
the United Kingdom. We and many other companies may need to implement
different or additional measures to establish or maintain legitimate means
for the transfer and receipt of personal data from the European Economic
Area and the United Kingdom to the United States, and we may, in addition to
other impacts, experience additional costs associated with increased
compliance burdens, and we and our clients face the potential for regulators
to apply different standards to the transfer of personal data from the
European Economic Area and the United Kingdom to the United States, and to
block, or require ad hoc verification of measures taken with respect to,
certain data flows from the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom to
the United States. We and our clients may face a risk of enforcement actions
by data protection authorities in the European Economic Area and the United
Kingdom relating to personal data transfers. Any such enforcement actions
could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, distract
management and technical personnel, and adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations. Any of these developments
may have an adverse effect on our business.

Another example is the State of California’s passage of the CCPA, which went
into effect on January 1, 2020, with implementing regulations taking effect
August 14, 2020, and which created new privacy rights for users residing in
the state. The California Privacy Rights Act was approved by California
voters in November 2020 and will significantly modify the CCPA, potentially
resulting in further uncertainty and requiring us to incur additional costs
and expenses in an effort to comply. There is also increased attention being
given to the collection of data from minors. For instance, COPPA requires
companies to obtain parental consent before collecting personal information
from children under the age of 13. Compliance with the GDPR, CCPA, COPPA,
and similar legal requirements, such as Law no. 13.709/2018 of Brazil, the
Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais , has required us and will continue
to require us to devote significant operational resources and incur
significant expenses. Our privacy compliance and oversight efforts will
require significant time and attention from our management and board of
directors.
                                     57                                     
                                                                            
  Table of Contents                                                         
                                                                            
Further, children’s privacy has been a focus of recent enforcement
activities and subjects our business to potential liability that could
adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.
Enforcement of COPPA, which requires companies to obtain parental consent
before collecting personal information from children under the age of
thirteen, has increased in recent years. In addition, the GDPR prohibits
certain processing of the personal information of children under the age of
thirteen to sixteen (depending on jurisdiction) without parental consent.
The CCPA requires companies to obtain the consent of children in California
under the age of sixteen (or parental consent for children under the age of
thirteen) before selling their personal information. Although we take
reasonable efforts to comply with these laws and regulations, we may in the
future face claims under COPPA, the GDPR, the CCPA, or other laws relating
to children’s privacy.

All of our mobile games are subject to our privacy policy and our terms of
service located in application storefronts, within our mobile games, and on
our corporate website. We generally comply with industry standards and are
subject to the terms of our privacy-related obligations and commitments to
users and third parties. We strive to comply with all applicable laws,
policies, legal obligations, and certain industry codes of conduct relating
to privacy and data protection, to the extent reasonably attainable.
However, it is possible that these obligations may be interpreted and
applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another
and may conflict with other rules or our practices. It is also possible that
new laws, policies, legal obligations, or industry codes of conduct may be
passed, or existing laws, policies, legal obligations, or industry codes of
conduct may be interpreted in such a way that could prevent us from being
able to offer services to citizens of a certain jurisdiction or may make it
costlier or more difficult for us to do so. Any failure or perceived failure
by us to comply with laws and regulations concerning privacy, information
security, data protection, consumer protection, and protection of minors;
our privacy policy and terms of service; our or other privacy-related
obligations to users or other third parties, or our privacy-related legal
obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized
release or transfer of personally identifiable information or other user
data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation, or public
statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause
our users to lose trust in us, which could adversely affect our business,
financial condition, or results of operations. Additionally, if third
parties we work with, such as users, developers, vendors, service providers,
or other business partners violate applicable laws or our policies, such
violations may also put our users’ information at risk and could in turn
adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, and results
of operations.
Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign laws, many of which
are unsettled and still developing, which could subject us to claims or     
otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.                                                                 
We are subject to a variety of laws in the United States and abroad that
affect our business, including state and federal laws regarding consumer
protection, electronic marketing, protection of minors, data protection, and
privacy, competition, taxation, intellectual property, money transmission,
money laundering, investment screening, export, and national security, which
are continuously evolving and developing. The scope and interpretation of
the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be
conflicting, particularly laws outside the United States. There is a risk
that existing or future laws may be interpreted in a manner that is not
consistent with our current practices and which could adversely affect our
business. As our Software Platform grows and evolves and our Software
Platform and our Apps are used in a greater number of countries, we may also
become subject to laws and regulations in additional jurisdictions or other
jurisdictions may claim that we are required to comply with their laws and
regulations.

With respect to our Apps, we are potentially subject to a number of foreign
and domestic laws and regulations that affect the offering of certain types
of content, such as content that depicts violence, the social casino game
genre, or loot boxes, many of which are ambiguous or still evolving and
could be interpreted in ways that could adversely affect our business or
expose us to liability. Some state attorney generals as well as other
international regulatory bodies have brought and may continue to bring legal
actions against social casino app developers and the third-party
distribution platforms for such apps. Further, several jurisdictions have
been regulating and continue to regulate the use of loot boxes in mobile
games. Loot boxes are a commonly used monetization technique in free-to-play
mobile games in which a user can acquire a virtual loot box, typically
through mobile game play or by using virtual goods, but the user does not
know which virtual good(s) he or she will receive (which may be a common,
rare, or extremely rare item, and may be a duplicate of an item the user
already has in his or her inventory) until the loot box is opened. The user
will always receive one or more virtual goods when he or she opens the loot
box, but the user does not know exactly which item(s) until the loot box is
opened. In April 2018, each of the Belgian Gaming Commission and the Dutch
Gambling Authority declared that loot boxes as implemented in certain games
by other companies that they reviewed constituted illegal gambling under
each country’s laws. Further, the Federal Trade Commission (the FTC) has
examined consumer protection issues related to loot boxes and various other
jurisdictions, including certain U.S. states, Australia, and the United
Kingdom are reviewing or have indicated that they intend to review the
legality of loot boxes and whether they constitute gambling. Additionally,
in May 2019, a bill was introduced to the Senate that would prohibit loot
boxes and pay-to-win micro-transactions in “minor oriented” games. In some
of our mobile games, certain mechanics may be deemed as “loot boxes”. New
regulation by the FTC, U.S. states, or other international jurisdictions
could require that these game mechanics be modified or removed from games or
that such apps be changed entirely, both of which could increase the costs
of operating our mobile games, impact user engagement and monetization, or
otherwise adversely affect our business. In addition, the increased
attention focused
                                     58                                     
                                                                            
  Table of Contents                                                         
                                                                            
upon liability issues as a result of lawsuits and legislative proposals
could harm our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business. It
is difficult to predict how existing or new laws may be applied to these or
similar game mechanics or genres. Further, laws or regulations may vary
significantly across jurisdictions.

It is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted or
construed to apply to us in the United States and elsewhere that could
restrict the mobile app ecosystem, including user privacy, advertising,
communications, taxation, content suitability, copyright, distribution, and
antitrust. Furthermore, the growth and development of electronic commerce
and virtual goods may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection
laws that may impose additional burdens on companies such as ours conducting
business through the internet and mobile devices. We anticipate that
scrutiny and regulation of our industry will increase and we will be
required to devote legal and other resources to addressing such regulation.
For example, existing laws or new laws regarding the marketing of IAPs,
labeling of free-to-play mobile games, or regulation of currency, banking
institutions, unclaimed property or money transmission may be interpreted to
cover our mobile games and the virtual currency, goods, or payments that we
receive. If that were to occur we may be required to seek licenses,
authorizations, or approvals from relevant regulators, the granting of which
may be dependent on us meeting certain capital and other requirements and we
may be subject to additional regulation and oversight, all of which could
significantly increase our operating costs. Changes in current laws or
regulations or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the United
States or elsewhere regarding these activities may lessen the growth of the
mobile app ecosystem. Any costs incurred as a result of adapting to laws and
regulations, or as a result of liability in connection therewith, could
adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.
We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and similar anti-      
corruption and anti-bribery laws, and non-compliance withsuch laws could    
subject us to criminal penalties or significant fines and adversely affect  
our business and reputation.                                                
We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the FCPA), the U.S.
domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. § 201, the U.S. Travel Act,
and similar anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws applicable in the
jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Anti-corruption and anti-bribery
laws have been enforced aggressively in recent years, are interpreted
broadly and prohibit companies, their employees, and third party business
partners, representatives, and agents from promising, authorizing, making or
offering improper payments or other benefits, directly or indirectly, to
government officials and others in the private sector in order to influence
official action, direct business to any person, gain any improper advantage,
or obtain or retain business. As we continue to expand our business
internationally, our risks under these laws increase.

We and our third-party business partners, representatives, and agents may
have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of
government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and we may be held
liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of our employees, third-
party business partners, representatives, and agents, even if we do not
explicitly authorize such activities. These laws also require that we keep
accurate books and records and maintain internal controls and compliance
procedures designed to prevent any such actions. While we have policies and
procedures to address compliance with such laws, we cannot assure you that
our employees, third-party business partners, representatives, and agents
will not take actions in violation of our policies or applicable law, for
which we may be ultimately held responsible and our exposure for violating
these laws increases as our international presence expands and as we
increase sales and operations in foreign jurisdictions.

Any violation of the FCPA or other applicable anti-corruption laws could
result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations,
loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions, suspension or
disbarment from U.S. government contracts, substantial diversion of
management’s attention, significant legal fees and fines, severe criminal or
civil sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, disgorgement of
profits, other sanctions and remedial measures, and prohibitions on the
conduct of our business, any of which could adversely affect our reputation,
business, financial condition, and results of operations.
We are subject to governmental export controls and economic sanctions laws  
that could impair our ability to compete in global markets or subject us to 
liability if we violate the controls.                                       
Our Core Technologies, Software Platform, and Apps may be subject to U.S.
export controls. Exports of our products and the underlying technology may
require export authorizations, including by license, a license exception, or
other appropriate government authorizations, including the filing of an
encryption classification request or self-classification report, as
applicable.

Furthermore, our activities are subject to U.S. economic sanctions laws and
regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of
Foreign Assets Control that prohibit the shipment of most technologies to
embargoed jurisdictions or sanctioned parties without the required export
authorizations. If we need to obtain any necessary export license or other
authorization for a particular sale, the process may be time-consuming and
may result in the delay or loss of opportunities to sell our products.
                                     59                                     
                                                                            
  Table of Contents                                                         
                                                                            
We take precautions to prevent our products and the underlying technology
from being provided, deployed or used in violation of export control and
sanctions laws, including implementation of IP address blocking and
sanctioned person screening, and are in the process of further enhancing our
policies and procedures relating to export control and sanctions compliance.
However, we cannot assure you that our policies and procedures relating to
export control and sanctions compliance will prevent violations in the
future by us or our partners or agents. If we are found to be in violation
of U.S. sanctions or export control regulations, including failure to obtain
appropriate import, export, or re-export licenses or permits, it can result
in significant penalties and government investigations, as well as
reputational harm and loss of business. Knowing and willful violations can
result in possible incarcerations for responsible employees and managers.

In addition to the United States, various other countries regulate the
import and export of certain encryption and other technology, including
import and export licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could
limit our ability to distribute our products or could limit our clients’
ability to implement our products in those countries. Changes in our Core
Technologies, Software Platform, or Apps, or future changes in export and
import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products and
the underlying technology in international markets, prevent our clients with
global operations from deploying our products globally, or, in some cases,
prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries,
governments, or persons altogether. From time to time, various governmental
agencies have proposed additional regulation of encryption technology.

Our growth strategy includes further expanding our operations and client and
user base in international markets and acquiring companies that may operate
in countries where we do not already do business. Such acquisitions may
subject us to additional or expanded export regulations. Further, any change
in export or import regulations or controls, economic sanctions or related
legislation, or change in the countries, governments, persons, or
technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of
our products by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products
to, existing or potential clients with global operations. Any decreased use
of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products
in major international markets could adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.
Changes in tax laws or tax rulings could adversely affect our effective tax 
rates, business, financial condition, and results of operations.            
The tax regimes we are subject to or operate under are unsettled and may be
subject to significant change. Changes in tax laws (including in response to
the COVID-19 pandemic) or tax rulings, or changes in interpretations of
existing laws, could cause us to be subject to additional income-based taxes
and non-income taxes (such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, digital tax,
net worth, property, and goods and services taxes), which in turn could
adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. For
example, in December 2017, the U.S. federal government enacted the tax
reform legislation known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the 2017 Tax Act).
The 2017 Tax Act significantly changed the existing U.S. corporate income
tax laws by, among other things, lowering the U.S. corporate tax rate,
implementing a partially territorial tax system, and imposing a one-time
deemed repatriation tax on certain post-1986 foreign earnings. In addition,
many countries in the European Union, as well as a number of other countries
and organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development, have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax
laws or have enacted new laws that could impact our tax obligations. Some of
these or other new rules could result in double taxation of our
international earnings. Any significant changes to our future effective tax
rate could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results
of operations.
We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.           
Our income tax obligations are based in part on our corporate operating
structure and intercompany arrangements, including the manner in which we
develop, value, manage, and use our intellectual property and the valuation
of our intercompany transactions. The tax laws applicable to our business,
including the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions, are subject
to interpretation and certain jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting
their laws in new ways in an effort to raise additional tax revenue. Our
existing corporate structure and intercompany arrangements have been
implemented in a manner we believe is in compliance with current prevailing
tax laws. However, the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we
operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or
intercompany arrangements, which could impact our worldwide effective tax
rate and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Moreover, changes to our corporate structure and intercompany agreements,
including through acquisitions, could impact our worldwide effective tax
rate and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.

In addition, we are subject to federal, state, and local taxes in the United
States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required
in evaluating our tax positions and our worldwide provision for (benefit
from) taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many
activities and transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is
uncertain. Our tax obligations and effective tax rates could be adversely
affected by changes in the relevant tax, accounting, and other laws,
regulations, principles, and interpretations, including those relating to
income tax nexus, by our earnings being lower than anticipated in
jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than
anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, by
challenges to our intercompany relationships and transfer pricing
arrangements. The relevant taxing authorities
                                     60                                     
                                                                            
  Table of Contents                                                         
                                                                            
may disagree with our determinations as to the income and expenses
attributable to specific jurisdictions. If such a disagreement were to
occur, and our position were not sustained, we could be required to pay
additional taxes, interest, and penalties, which could result in one-time
tax charges, higher effective tax rates, reduced cash flows and lower
overall profitability of our business, with some changes possibly affecting
our tax obligations in future or past years. We believe that our financial
statements reflect adequate reserves to cover such a contingency, but there
can be no assurances in that regard.
Taxing authorities may successfully assert that we should have collected or 
in the future should collect sales and use, value added or similar taxes,   
and any such assessments could adversely affect our business, financial     
condition, and results of operations.                                       
We do not collect sales and use, value added, and similar taxes in all
jurisdictions in which we have sales, based on our belief that such taxes
are not applicable in certain jurisdictions. Sales and use, value added, and
similar tax laws and rates vary greatly by jurisdiction. Certain
jurisdictions in which we do not collect such taxes may assert that such
taxes are applicable or that our presence in such jurisdictions is
sufficient to require us to collect taxes, which could result in tax
assessments, penalties, and interest, and we may be required to collect such
taxes in the future. Such tax assessments, penalties, and interest or future
requirements may adversely affect our financial condition and results of
operations. Further, in June 2018, the Supreme Court held in South Dakota v.
Wayfair, Inc. that states could impose sales tax collection obligations on
out-of-state sellers even if those sellers lack any physical presence within
the states imposing the sales taxes. Under the Wayfair decision, a person
requires only a “substantial nexus” with the taxing state before the state
may subject the person to sales tax collection obligations therein. An
increasing number of states (both before and after the publication of the
Wayfair decision) have considered or adopted laws that attempt to impose
sales tax collection obligations on out-of-state sellers. The Supreme
Court’s Wayfair decision has removed a significant impediment to the
enactment and enforcement of these laws, and it is possible that states may
seek to tax out-of-state sellers on sales that occurred in prior tax years,
which could create additional administrative burdens for us, put us at a
competitive disadvantage if such states do not impose similar obligations on
our competitors, and decrease our future sales, which could adversely affect
our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
If we are found liable for content that is distributed through or           
advertising that is served through our Software Platform or Apps, our       
business could be adversely affected.                                       
As a distributor of content, we face potential liability for negligence,
copyright, patent or trademark infringement, public performance royalties,
or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we
distribute. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the DMCA) is intended, in
part, to limit the liability of eligible service providers for caching,
hosting, or linking to user content that includes materials that infringe
copyrights or other rights. We rely on the protections provided by the DMCA
in conducting our business. Similarly, Section 230 of the Communications
Decency Act (Section 230) protects online distribution platforms, such as
ours, from actions taken under various laws that might otherwise impose
liability on the platform provider for what content creators develop or the
actions they take or inspire.

However, the DMCA, Section 230, and similar statutes and doctrines that we
may rely on in the future are subject to uncertain judicial interpretation
and regulatory and legislative amendments. Future regulatory or legislative
changes may ultimately require us to take a more active approach towards
content moderation, which could diminish the depth, breadth, and variety of
content we offer and, in so doing, reduce our revenue. Moreover, the DMCA
and Section 230 provide protections primarily in the United States. If the
rules around these statutes and doctrines change, if international
jurisdictions refuse to apply similar protections, or if a court were to
disagree with our application of those rules to our business, we could incur
liability and our business could be adversely affected. If we become liable
for these types of claims as a result of the content that is included in our
Apps or the advertisements that are served through our Software Platform,
then our business may be adversely affected. Litigation to defend these
claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any
liability could adversely affect our business. Our insurance may not be
adequate to cover these types of claims or any liability that may be imposed
on us.

In addition, regardless of any legal protections that may limit our
liability for the actions of third parties, we may incur significant legal
expenses and other costs if copyright holders assert claims, or commence
litigation, alleging copyright infringement against our third-party
developers. While we prohibit mobile apps without distribution rights from
the copyright holder, and we maintain processes and systems for the
reporting and removal of infringing mobile apps, such prohibitions,
processes, and systems may not always be successful. If other developers,
licensees, platform providers, business partners, and personnel are
influenced by the existence of types of claims or proceedings and are
deterred from working with us as a consequence, our ability to maintain or
expand our business, including through international expansion plans, could
be adversely affected.
We will incur increased costs and demands upon management as a result of    
complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies, which   
could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of    
operations.                                                                 
                                     61                                     
                                                                            
  Table of Contents                                                         
                                                                            
We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-
Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank
Act), and the rules and regulations of the SEC and the Nasdaq listing
standards. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file
annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and
results of operations. Compliance with these requirements has increased and
will continue to increase our legal, accounting, and financial compliance
costs and increase demand on our systems, making some activities more time-
consuming and costly. We expect these rules and regulations to make it more
expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we
may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur
substantially higher costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. As a
result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified
individuals to serve on our board of directors or as our executive officers.
As a public company, we expect to incur significant expenses and devote
substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with the auditor
attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In that
regard, we will need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with
appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge. In
addition, as a public company, we may be subject to shareholder activism,
which can lead to substantial costs, distract management, and impact the
manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently
anticipate.

As a result of disclosure of information in our public filings with the SEC
as required of a public company, our business and financial condition will
become more visible, which we believe may result in threatened or actual
litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If such claims
are successful, our business, financial condition, and results of operations
could be adversely affected, and even if the claims do not result in
litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and
resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our
management and our board of directors and adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.
Legal or regulatory proceedings and settlements could cause us to incur     
additional expenses or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial   
condition, and results of operations.                                       
We are involved in or may become involved in claims, suits, government
investigations, including formal and informal inquiries from government
authorities and regulators, and proceedings arising in the ordinary course
of our business, including actions with respect to intellectual property
claims, securities claims, privacy, data protection, or law enforcement
matters, tax matters, labor and employment claims, commercial and
acquisition-related claims, and other matters. We may become the subject of
investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests for information, actions,
and audits in the United States, Europe, and around the world, particularly
in the areas of privacy, data protection, law enforcement, consumer
protection, and competition, as we continue to grow and expand our
operations. In addition, we are currently, and may in the future be, subject
to regulatory orders or consent decrees. For example, data protection,
competition, and consumer protection authorities in the European Union have
initiated actions, investigations, or administrative orders seeking to
restrict the ways in which we collect and use information, or impose
sanctions, and other authorities may do the same.

Any such claims, suits, government investigations, and proceedings are
inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty.
Regardless of their outcomes, such legal or regulatory proceedings can have
an adverse impact on us because of legal costs, diversion of management and
other personnel attention, and other factors. In addition, it is possible
that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in
substantial costs, civil and criminal liability, penalties, or sanctions, as
well as judgments, consent decrees, or orders preventing us from offering
certain features, functionalities, products or services, or requiring a
change in our business practices, products or technologies, which could
adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, and results
of operations.
                                                                            
  Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property                                
                                                                            
Many of our products and services contain open source software, and we      
license some of our software through open source projects, which may pose   
particular risks to our proprietary software, products, and services in a   
manner that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and   
results of operations.                                                      
We use open source software in our Core Technologies, Software Platform, and
Apps and expect to continue to use open source software in the future. In
addition, we contribute software source code to open source projects under
open source licenses or release internal software projects under open source
licenses, and anticipate continuing to do so in the future. The terms of
many open source licenses to which we are subject have not been interpreted
by U.S. or foreign courts, and there is a risk that open source software
licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated
conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide or distribute our
products or services. Additionally, under some open source licenses, if we
combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain
manner, third parties may claim ownership of, a license to, or demand
release of, the open source software or derivative works that we developed
using such software, which could include our proprietary source code. Such
third parties may also seek to enforce the terms of the applicable open
source license through litigation which, if successful, could require us to
make our proprietary software source code freely available, purchase a
costly license, or cease offering the implicated products or services unless
and until we can re-engineer them to avoid infringement. This re-engineering
process could require significant additional research and development
resources, and we may not be able to complete
                                     62                                     
                                                                            
  Table of Contents                                                         
                                                                            
it successfully. In addition to risks related to open source license
requirements, use of certain open source software may pose greater risks
than use of third-party commercial software, since open source licensors
generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of software.
Any of these risks could be difficult to eliminate or manage, and, if not
addressed, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and
results of operations.
Our ability to acquire and maintain licenses to intellectual property may   
affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.        
Competition for these licenses may make them more expensive and increase our
costs.                                                                      
While most of the intellectual property we use in our Core Technologies,
Software Platform, and Apps is created by us, from time to time, we also
acquire rights to third-party intellectual property. Proprietary licenses
may limit our use of intellectual property to specific uses and for specific
time periods, require time and attention of licensors in providing guidance
and related approvals, and include other contractual obligations with which
we must comply. Additionally, competition for these licenses is intense and
often results in increased advances, minimum payment guarantees, and
royalties to the licensor, and as such we may be unable to identify suitable
licensing targets or complete licensing arrangements. If we are unable to
obtain and remain in compliance with the terms of these licenses or obtain
additional licenses on reasonable economic terms, our business and results
of operations could be adversely affected. Further, if the mix of IAPs
shifts toward mobile games in which we use licensed intellectual property or
if we develop additional Apps that require licensing of third-party
intellectual property, our overall margins may be reduced due to royalty
obligations.

In addition, many of our Apps are built on proprietary source code of third
parties, such as Unity Software. Unity Software offers certain solutions
that may compete with our offerings. If we are unable to renew licenses to
proprietary source code underlying our mobile games, or the terms and
conditions of these licenses change at the time of renewal, our business,
financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.
We rely on third parties, including Unity Software, to maintain versions of
their proprietary engines that allow us to distribute our mobile games on
multiple platforms. If a third party from whom we license source code
discontinues support for one or more of these platforms, our business,
financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.
Failure to protect or enforce our proprietary and intellectual property     
rights or the costs involved in such enforcement could adversely affect our 
business, financial condition, and results of operations.                   
We regard our Core Technologies, Software Platform, and Apps and related
source code as proprietary and rely on a variety of methods, including a
combination of copyright, patent, trademark, and trade secret laws and
employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements, to protect our
proprietary rights. We view the protection of our trade secrets, copyrights,
trademarks, service marks, trade dress, domain names, patents, and other
product rights as critical to our success. We strive to protect our
intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state, and common law
rights, as well as contractual restrictions and business practices. We also
enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our
employees and contractors and confidentiality agreements with parties with
whom we conduct business in order to limit access to, and disclosure and use
of, our proprietary information. However, these contractual arrangements and
business practices may not prevent the misappropriation of our proprietary
information or deter independent development of similar technologies by
others.

We own or license, and pursue the registration of, copyrights, trademarks,
service marks, domain names, and patents in the United States and in certain
locations outside the United States. This process can be expensive and time-
consuming, may not always be successful depending on local laws or other
circumstances, and we also may choose not to pursue registrations in every
location depending on the nature of the project to which the intellectual
property rights pertain. We may, over time, increase our investments in
protecting our creative works.

We are aware that some unauthorized copying of our Apps occurs, and if a
significantly greater amount of unauthorized copying of our Apps were to
occur, it could adversely affect our business. In addition, even if
authorized copying of our Apps occurs, third-party platforms may not remove
infringing material. We also cannot be certain that existing intellectual
property laws will provide adequate protection for our products in
connection with emerging technologies. Litigation may be necessary to
enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets, or
determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others.
Any litigation of this nature, regardless of outcome or merit, could result
in substantial costs, adverse publicity, and diversion of management and
technical resources. If we fail to maintain, protect, and enhance our
intellectual property rights, our business, financial condition, and results
of operations could be adversely affected.
We are, and may in the future be, subject to intellectual property disputes,
which are costly to defend and could require us to pay significant damages  
and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future.      
From time to time, we have faced, and we may face in the future, allegations
that we have infringed the trademarks, copyrights, patents, and other
intellectual property rights of third parties, including from our
competitors, non-practicing entities and former employers of our personnel.
Intellectual property litigation may be protracted and expensive, and the
results are difficult to predict. As the result of any court judgment or
settlement, we may be obligated to alter our Software Platform or Apps, in a
particular geographic region or worldwide, pay royalties or significant
settlement costs, purchase licenses, or develop substitutes.
                                     63                                     
                                                                            
  Table of Contents                                                         
                                                                            
In certain of our agreements we also indemnify our licensees and other
business partners. We may incur significant expenses defending these
business partners if they are sued for intellectual property infringement
based on allegations related to our technology. If a business partner were
to lose a lawsuit and in turn seek indemnification from us, we also could be
subject to significant monetary liabilities. In addition, because our Core
Technologies, Software Platform, and Apps often involve the use of third-
party technology, this increases our exposure to litigation in circumstances
where there is a claim of infringement asserted against one of our mobile
games or other products and services in question, even if the claim does not
pertain to our technology.
                                                                            
   Risks Related to Financial and Accounting Matters                        
                                                                            
If we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and       
internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and
accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be
impaired.                                                                   
As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the
Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the rules and regulations of the
applicable Nasdaq listing standards. We expect that the requirements of
these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting,
and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-
consuming and costly, and place significant strain on our personnel,
systems, and resources.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain
effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure
controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we will file with the SEC
is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods
specified in SEC rules and forms and that information required to be
disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to our principal executive and financial officers. We are also continuing to
improve our internal control over financial reporting, which includes hiring
additional accounting and financial personnel to implement such processes
and controls.

In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we
have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant
resources, including accounting-related costs and significant management
oversight. If any of these new or improved controls and systems do not
perform as expected, we may experience further deficiencies in our controls.

Our current controls and any new controls that we develop may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. Further, to the
extent we acquire other businesses, the acquired company may not have a
sufficiently robust system of controls and we may discover deficiencies. Any
failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties
encountered in their implementation or improvement could adversely affect
our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting
obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for
prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal
control over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of
periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public
accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting that we will eventually be
required to include in our periodic reports that will be filed with the SEC.
Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our
reported financial and other information, which would likely cause the
market price of our Class A common stock to decline. In addition, if we are
unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain
listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. Prior to our initial public
offering, we were not required to comply with the SEC rules that implement
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and were therefore not required to
make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting for that purpose. As a public company, we are required
to provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting commencing with our second annual report
on Form 10-K.

Our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to
formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting commencing with our second annual report on Form 10-K. At such
time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report
that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our
internal control over financial reporting is documented, designed, or
operating. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and
internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect our
business, financial condition, and results of operations and could cause the
market price of our Class A common stock to decline.
Our results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in         
financial accounting standards or by the application of existing or future  
accounting standards to our business as it evolves.                         
Our reported results of operations are impacted by the accounting standards
promulgated by the SEC and accounting standards bodies and the methods,
estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies. A
change in accounting standards could have a significant effect on our
reported financial results, and may even affect the reporting of
                                     64                                     
                                                                            
  Table of Contents                                                         
                                                                            
transactions completed before the announcement or effectiveness of a change.
The frequency of accounting standards changes could accelerate, including
conversion to unified international accounting standards. Accounting
standards affecting revenue recognition have affected, and could further
significantly affect, the way we account for revenue. Any future changes to
accounting standards may cause our results of operations to fluctuate. For
example, if the accounting standards for revenue derived from free-to-play
mobile games were to change, particularly with respect to revenue generated
from digital storefronts, our results of operations could be adversely
affected.

Further, although we believe our estimates are reasonable based on available
user information, we may revise such estimates in the future in the event
our users’ average playing period changes. Any adjustments arising from
changes in the estimates of the lives of these virtual goods would be
applied to the current quarter and prospectively on the basis that such
changes are caused by new information indicating a change in the user
behavior patterns of our users. As we enhance, expand and diversify our
business and product offerings, the application of existing or future
financial accounting standards could adversely our results of operations.
We rely on assumptions, estimates and unaudited financial information to    
calculate certain of our key metrics and other figures that we disclose, and
real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics could adversely affect our   
reputation and our business.                                                
Certain of the metrics that we disclose are calculated using internal
company data that has not been independently verified, data from third-party
attribution partners, or unaudited financial information of companies that
we have acquired or partnered with. While these metrics and figures are
based on what we believe to be reasonable calculations for the applicable
period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring these
metrics and figures across our worldwide client base and user base.
Additionally, certain figures that we disclose relating to our strategic
acquisitions and partnerships are based on unaudited financial information
that has been prepared by the management of such companies and has not been
independently reviewed or audited. We cannot assure you that such financial
information would not be materially different if such information was
independently reviewed or audited. We regularly review and may adjust our
processes for calculating our metrics and other figures to improve their
accuracy, but these efforts may not prove successful and we may discover
material inaccuracies. In addition, our methodology for calculating these
metrics may differ from the methodology used by other companies to calculate
similar metrics and figures. We may also discover unexpected errors in the
data that we are using that resulted from technical or other errors. If we
determine that any of our metrics or figures are not accurate, we may be
required to revise or cease reporting such metrics or figures. Any real or
perceived inaccuracies in our metrics and other figures could harm our
reputation and adversely affect our business.
Conversion of key internal systems and processes, particularly our          
enterprise resource planning system, and problems with the design,          
implementation, or operation of these systems and processes could interfere 
with, and therefore adversely affect, our business and operations.          
We converted certain key internal business systems and processes, including
our enterprise resource planning system, to a cloud-based system. We have
invested, and will continue to invest, significant capital and human
resources in the design, implementation, and operation of these business
systems and processes. Any problems in the functioning of these systems or
processes, particularly any that impact our operations, could adversely
affect our ability to process payments, record and transfer information in a
timely and accurate manner, recognize revenue, file SEC reports in a timely
manner, or otherwise run our business and could adversely affect our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.
We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our        
goodwill becomes impaired.                                                  
We are required under GAAP to review our goodwill for impairment at least
annually or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate
the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that may be considered a
change in circumstances, indicating a requirement to reevaluate whether our
goodwill continues to be recoverable, include a significant decline in the
market price of our Class A common stock and our market capitalization,
slower growth rates in our industry, or other materially adverse events. We
may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial
statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill is
determined.
We have substantial indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities 
and our obligations thereunder may limit our operational flexibility or     
otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.                                                                 
We are party to a credit agreement that provides for senior secured credit
consisting of term loans and a revolving credit facility, which are
scheduled to mature in 2025. As of March 31, 2021, the aggregate principal
amount of our outstanding indebtedness under our credit facilities was $2.19
billion, consisting of $1.79 billion in aggregate principal amount of term
loans and $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of borrowings under
our revolving credit facility. Subsequent to March 31, 2021, we repaid in
full our borrowings under our revolving credit facility. There can be no
assurance that we will be able to repay this indebtedness when due, or that
we will be able to refinance this indebtedness on acceptable terms or at
all.
                                     65

Our indebtedness could adversely impact us. For example, these obligations  
could among other things:

  •    limit our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in     
       our business.                                                        
                                                                            
In addition, from time to time we have entered into interest rate swap      
instruments to limit our exposure to changes in variable interest rates.    
While our hedging strategy is designed to minimize the impact of increases  
in interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt, including our credit
facility, there can be no guarantee that our hedging strategy will be       
effective, and we may experience credit-related losses in some              
circumstances. Our credit agreement also imposes restrictions on us and     
requires us to maintain compliance with specified covenants. Our ability to 
comply with these covenants may be affected by market, economic, financial, 
competitive, legislative, and regulatory factors, as well as other factors  
that are beyond our control. A breach of any of the covenants in the credit 
agreement governing our credit facilities could result in an event of       
default, which, if not cured or waived, could trigger acceleration of our   
indebtedness and an increase in the interest rates applicable to such       
indebtedness, and may result in the acceleration of or default under any    
other debt we may incur in the future to which a cross-acceleration or      
cross-default provision applies. In addition, we have granted a security    
interest in a significant portion of our assets to secure our obligations   
under our credit facility. During the existence of an event of default under
our credit agreement, the applicable lenders could exercise their rights and
remedies thereunder, including by way of initiating foreclosure proceedings 
against any assets constituting collateral for our obligations under the    
credit facility. The acceleration of the indebtedness under our credit      
agreement or under any other indebtedness could have a material and adverse 
effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We  
may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our significant   
debt service obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our 
business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Our   
ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations  
depends on our financial condition and results of operations, which are     
subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain    
financial, business, legislative, regulatory, and other factors beyond our  
control. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating
activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, or
interest on our indebtedness. If our cash flows and capital resources are   
insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to      
reduce or delay strategic acquisitions and partnerships, capital            
expenditures, and payments on account of other obligations, seek additional 
capital, restructure or refinance our indebtedness, or sell assets. These   
alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our
scheduled debt service obligations. Our ability to restructure or refinance 
our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our        
financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at   
higher interest rates and could require us to comply with more onerous      
covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. In         
addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our 
indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable  
to repay or otherwise refinance our indebtedness when due, or if any other  
event of default is not cured or waived, the applicable lenders could       
accelerate our outstanding obligations or proceed against the collateral    
granted to them to secure that indebtedness, which could force us into      
bankruptcy or liquidation. In the event the applicable lenders accelerate   
the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have       
sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. Any acceleration of amounts   
due under the agreements governing our credit facility or the exercise by   
the applicable lenders of their rights under the security documents could   
have a material and adverse effect on our business. 66

We may require additional capital to meet our financial obligations and     
support business growth, and this capital may not be available on acceptable
terms or at all.                                                            
We intend to continue to make significant investments to support our
business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business
challenges, including the need to develop our Software Platform and Software
Platform, enhance our existing Apps and develop new Apps and features,
improve our operating infrastructure, or enter into strategic acquisitions
and partnerships. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity, equity-
linked, or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise
additional funds through future issuances of equity or convertible debt
securities, our existing stockholders could experience significant dilution,
and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and
privileges superior to those of holders of our Class A common stock. Any
debt financing that we secure in the future could involve offering
additional security interests and undertaking restrictive covenants relating
to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational
matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional
capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential
acquisitions. Our credit agreement, which provides for a term loan and
revolving credit facility, contains financial covenants with which we must
comply. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable
to us, if at all. Additionally, if we seek to access additional capital or
increase our borrowing, there can be no assurance that financing and credit
may be available on favorable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain
adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require
it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to
business challenges could be significantly impaired, and our business,
financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely affected.
The London Interbank Offered Rate calculation method may change and LIBOR is
expected to be phased out after 2021.                                       
Interest on our term loan and revolving credit facility, which are scheduled
to mature in 2025, may be calculated based on the London Interbank Offered
Rate (LIBOR). On July 27, 2017, the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (the
authority that administers LIBOR) announced that it intends to phase out
LIBOR by the end of 2021. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating
LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021, or if
alternative rates or benchmarks will be adopted. Changes in the method of
calculating LIBOR, or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative rate or
benchmark, may adversely affect interest rates and result in higher
borrowing costs. This could materially and adversely affect our results of
operations, cash flows, and liquidity. We cannot predict the effect of the
potential changes to LIBOR or the establishment and use of alternative rates
or benchmarks. We may need to renegotiate our credit facility or incur other
indebtedness, and changes in the method of calculating LIBOR, or the use of
an alternative rate or benchmark, may negatively impact the terms of such
renegotiated credit facility or such other indebtedness. If changes are made
to the method of calculating LIBOR or LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to
amend certain contracts and cannot predict what alternative rate or
benchmark would be negotiated. This may result in an increase to our
interest expense.
Risks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock and Governance       
                                                                            
The multi-class structure of our common stock and the Voting Agreement among
the Class B Stockholders have the effect of concentrating voting power with 
the Class B Stockholders, which will limit your ability to influence the    
outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the
election of our board of directors, the adoption of amendments to our       
certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and the approval of any merger,    
consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other     
major corporate transaction.                                                
We have three classes of common stock. Our Class A common stock has one vote
per share, our Class B common stock has 20 votes per share, and our Class C
common stock has no voting rights, except as otherwise required by law. Adam
Foroughi, our co-founder, CEO, and Chairperson; Herald Chen, our President
and Chief Financial Officer, and a member of our board of directors; and KKR
Denali (collectively with certain affiliates, the Class B Stockholders)
together hold all of the issued and outstanding shares of our Class B common
stock. As of April 19, 2021, the closing date of our initial public
offering, the Class B Stockholders collectively held approximately 93.4% of
the voting power of our outstanding capital stock in the aggregate. This
voting power includes shares of Class A common stock deemed beneficially
owned in accordance with Rule 13d-3(d)(1) under the Exchange Act. The
Class B Stockholders have entered into a voting agreement (the Voting
Agreement) whereby all Class B common stock held by the Class B Stockholders
and their respective permitted entities and permitted transferees will be
voted as determined by two of Mr. Foroughi, Mr. Chen, and KKR Denali (one of
which must be Mr. Foroughi). As a result, the Class B Stockholders, in
particular, Mr. Foroughi, Mr. Chen, and KKR Denali, will be able to
determine or significantly influence any action requiring the approval of
our stockholders, including the election of our board of directors, the
adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and
the approval of any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all
of our assets, or other major corporate transaction. The Class B
Stockholders may have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way
with which you disagree, and which may be adverse to your interests. This
concentrated control may have the effect of delaying, preventing, or
deterring a change in control of our company, could deprive our stockholders
of an opportunity to receive

a premium for their capital stock as part of a sale of our company, and     
might ultimately affect the market price of our Class A common stock. Future
transfers by the holders of Class B common stock will generally result in   
those shares automatically converting into shares of Class A common stock,  
subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate
planning, transfers among KKR affiliates, or other transfers among the Class
B Stockholders. In addition, each share of Class B common stock will convert
automatically into one share of Class A common stock upon certain events    
specified in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. In      
addition, because our Class C common stock carries no voting rights (except 
as otherwise required by law), if we issue Class C common stock in the      
future, the holders of Class B common stock may be able to elect all of our 
directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote  
of our stockholders for a longer period of time than would be the case if we
issued Class A common stock rather than Class C common stock in such        
transactions. We are considered a “controlled company” within the meaning of
the Nasdaq corporate governance requirements, and, as a result, we qualify  
for, and intend to rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance    
requirements. As a result of our multi-class common stock structure and the 
Voting Agreement among the Class B Stockholders, the Class B Stockholders   
collectively hold greater than a majority of the voting power of our        
outstanding capital stock and the Class B Stockholders have the authority to
vote the shares of all Class B common stock, subject to the terms of the    
Voting Agreement, at their discretion on all matters to be voted upon by    
stockholders. Therefore, we are considered a “controlled company” as that   
term is set forth in the Nasdaq corporate governance requirements. Under    
these corporate governance requirements, a company in which over 50% of the 
voting power for the election of directors is held by an individual, a      
group, or another company is a “controlled company” and may elect not to    
comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including:           
                                                                            
  •    the requirement that a majority of its board of directors consist    
       of independent directors;                                            
                                                                            
                                                                            
       the requirement that we have a nominating/corporate governance       
  •    committee that is comprised entirely of independent directors with   
       a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and             
       responsibilities;                                                    
                                                                            
                                                                            
       the requirement that we have a compensation committee that is        
  •    comprised entirely of independent directors with a written charter   
       addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities; and         
                                                                            
                                                                            
  •    the requirement for an annual performance evaluation of the          
       nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees.     
                                                                            
We currently utilize, and intend to continue to utilize, certain of these   
exemptions. As a result, we do not have a majority of independent directors 
and our compensation committee does not consist entirely of independent     
directors. Accordingly, you will not have the same protections afforded to  
stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate          
governance requirements. In the event that we cease to be a “controlled     
company” and our Class A common stock continues to be listed on Nasdaq, we  
will be required to comply with these provisions within the applicable      
transaction periods. We cannot predict the effect our multi-class structure 
may have on the market price of our Class A common stock. We cannot predict 
whether our multi-class structure will result in a lower or more volatile   
market price of our Class A common stock, in adverse publicity, or other    
adverse consequences. For example, certain index providers have announced   
restrictions on including companies with multi-class share structures in    
certain of their indices. In July 2017, FTSE Russell announced that it plans
to require new constituents of its indices to have greater than 5% of the   
company’s voting rights in the hands of public stockholders, and S&P Dow    
Jones announced that it will no longer admit companies with multi-class     
share structures to certain of its indices. Affected indices include the    
Russell 2000 and the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, and S&P SmallCap 600, which   
together make up the S&P Composite 1500. Also in 2017, MSCI, a leading stock
index provider, opened public consultations on their treatment of no-voteand
multi-class structures and temporarily barred new multi-class listings from 
certain of its indices and in October 2018, MSCI announced its decision to  
include equity securities “with unequal voting structures” in its indices   
and to launch a new index that specifically includes voting rights in its   
eligibility criteria. Under such announced policies, the multi-class        
structure of our common stock would make us ineligible for inclusion in     
certain indices and, as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and  
other investment vehicles that attempt to track those indices would not     
invest in our Class A common stock. These policies are relatively new and it
is unclear what effect, if any, they will have on the valuations of         
publicly-traded companies excluded from such indices, but it is possible    
that they may depress valuations, as compared to similar companies that are 
included. Given the sustained flow of investment funds into passive         
strategies that seek to track certain indices, exclusion from certain stock 
indices would likely preclude investment by many of these funds and could   
make our Class A common stock less attractive to other investors. As a      
result, the market price of our Class A common stock could be adversely     
affected. 68

In addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in     
general experiences a loss of investor confidence, the market price of our  
Class A common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business,   
financial condition, or results of operations. The market price of our Class
A common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other   
companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us.   
Accordingly, we cannot assure you of the liquidity of any trading market,   
your ability to sell your shares of our Class A common stock when desired,  
or the prices that you may obtain for your shares of our Class A common     
stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a
company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been     
brought against that company. If the market price of our Class A common     
stock is volatile, we may become the target of securities litigation.       
Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our      
management’s attention and resources from our business. Such litigation     
could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of    
operations. 69

Because we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock 
in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole  
source of gain. You should not rely on an investment in our Class A common  
stock to provide dividend income. We do not anticipate paying cash dividends
in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain future earnings, if
any, to fund the development and growth of our business. In addition, our   
credit agreement contains, and any future credit facility or financing we   
obtain may contain, terms limiting the amount of dividends that may be      
declared or paid on our Class A common stock. Any future determination to   
pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will  
be dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital   
requirements, and applicable contractual restrictions. As a result,         
stockholders should rely on sales of their Class A common stock after price 
appreciation as the only way to realize any future gains on their           
investment. A substantial portion of the outstanding shares of our Class A  
common stock is restricted from immediate resale, but may be sold in the    
near future. The large number of shares eligible for public sale or subject 
to rights requiring us to register them for public sale could depress the   
market price of our Class A common stock. The market price of our Class A   
common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares 
of our Class A common stock in the market in the near future and the        
perception that these sales could occur may also depress the market price of
our Class A common stock. All of our directors and executive officers, and  
the holders of substantially all of our outstanding equity securities have  
entered into market standoff agreements with us or have entered into lock-  
upagreements with the underwriters of our initial public offering under     
which they have agreed, subject to specific exceptions, not to sell any of  
our stock during the period ending 180 days after the date of the final     
prospectus (the lock-upperiod) relating to our initial public offering (the 
Prospectus), dated April 14, 2021 and filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) under

       announcement, either through a major news service or on a            
       Form8-K,at least five trading days in advance of the date of such    
       earnings announcement. This Earnings-Related Release will not apply  
       to shares owned by any limited liability company, partnership,       
       corporation, trust, or other entity (including, without limitation,  
       any investment fund), unless all of the equity interests and other

To the extent not released on the First Trading Day Release or Earnings-    
Related Release described above, pursuant to the lock-upagreements, if (i)  
at least 120 days have elapsed since the date of the Prospectus, and (ii)   
the lock-upperiod is scheduled to end during or within five trading days    
prior to a regularly-scheduled blackout period under our insider trading    
policy, the lock-upperiod will end 10 trading days prior to the commencement
of such blackout period (the Blackout-Related Release); provided that in the
event the lock-upperiod will end during such period, we will notify the     
representatives of the date of the impending Blackout-Related Release       
promptly upon our determination of the date of the Blackout-Related Release 
and in any event at least seven trading days in advance of the date of the  
Blackout-Related Release, and will announce the date of the expected        
Blackout-Related Release through a major news service, or on a Form 8-K,at  
least two trading days in advance of the Blackout-Related Release. If not   
earlier released, all of our outstanding shares of Class A common stock,    
other than those sold in our initial public offering which are freely       
tradable, will become eligible for sale upon expiration of the lock-        
upperiod, except for any shares held by our affiliates as defined in Rule   
144 under the Securities Act. 70

Following the expiration of the lock-upperiod, certain stockholders will be 
entitled, under our investors’ rights agreement, to certain demand          
registration rights. Holders of shares of our Class A common stock issued   
upon conversion of the convertible securities issued in connection with our 
acquisition of Adjust are also be entitled to these rights with respect to  
such shares. In addition, we filed a registration statement to register     
shares reserved for future issuance under our equity compensation plans and 
a registration statement to register shares of Class A common stock issued  
pursuant to our 2011 Equity Incentive Plan for resale in connection with the
First Trading Day Release. As a result, subject to the satisfaction of      
applicable exercise periods and compliance with the market standoff         
agreements and lock-up agreementsreferred to above, the registered shares,  
including those issued upon exercise of outstanding stock options, will be  
available for immediate resale in the United States in the open market.     
Sales of our Class A common stock as restrictions end or pursuant to        
registration rights may make it more difficult for us to sell equity        
securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. 
These sales also could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to
fall and make it more difficult for you to sell shares of our Class A common
stock. The issuance of additional stock in connection with financings,      
acquisitions, investments, our equity incentive plans, or otherwise will    
dilute all other stockholders. Our amended and restated certificate of      
incorporation authorizes us to issue up to 1,500,000,000 shares of Class A  
common stock, up to 150,000,000 shares of Class C common stock, and up to   
100,000,000 shares of preferred stock with such rights and preferences as   
may be determined by our board of directors. Subject to compliance with     
applicable rules and regulations, we may issue shares of Class A common     
stock or securities convertible into shares of our Class A common stock from
time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investment, our   
equity incentive plans, or otherwise. For example, in connection with our   
acquisition of Adjust in April 2021, we issued convertible securities that  
automatically convert into an aggregate number of shares of our Class A     
common stock determined by dividing $352.0 million by the volume-weighted   
average trading price per share of our Class A common stock over any 10     
consecutive full trading day period (chosen by the stockholder              
representative under the share purchase agreement) within 20 trading days   
commencing with and following April 15, 2021. Any such issuance could result
in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the market   
price of our Class A common stock to decline. Our multi-class stock         
structure, the Voting Agreement, and other provisions in our amended and    
restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could 
make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing 
the market price of our Class A common stock. Our amended and restated      
certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain        
provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult,     
including the following:                                                    
                                                                            
       our multi-class common stock structure and the Voting Agreement,     
       which provide the Class B Stockholders with the ability to           
  •    determine or significantly influence the outcome of matters          
       requiring stockholder approval, even if they own significantly less  
       than a majority of the shares of our outstanding common stock;

These provisions, alone or together, could discourage, delay, or prevent a  
transaction involving a change in control of our company. These provisions  
could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for         
stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take   
other corporate actions they desire, any of which, under certain            
circumstances, could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a
premium for their shares of our Class A common stock, and could also affect 
the market price of our Class A common stock. 71

Our amended and restated bylaws designate a state or federal court located  
within the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United  
States as the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and 
our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to choose the 
judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or          
employees. Our amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent  
in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, to the fullest extent  
permitted by law, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action
or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of   
breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, or other 
employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action arising pursuant to   
any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and      
restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws,  
or (iv) any other action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal 
affairs doctrine shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware    
(or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal       
district court for the District of Delaware), in all cases subject to the   
court having jurisdiction over indispensable parties named as defendants,   
and provided that this exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits    
brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act.       
Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal
and state courts over all such Securities Act actions. Accordingly, both    
state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. To     
prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat  
of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different courts, among other        
considerations, our amended and restated bylaws also provide that the       
federal district courts of the United States of America will be the         
exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action     
arising under the Securities Act. However, while the Delaware Supreme Court 
ruled in March 2020 that federal forum selection provisions purporting to   
require claims under the Securities Act be brought in federal court are     
“facially valid” under Delaware law, there is uncertainty as to whether     
other courts will enforce our federal forum provision. If the federal forum 
provision is found to be unenforceable, we may incur additional costs       
associated with resolving such matters. Any person or entity purchasing or  
otherwise acquiring or holding or owning (or continuing to hold or own) any 
interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and     
consented to the foregoing bylaw provisions. Although we believe these      
exclusive forum provisions benefit us by providing increased consistency in 
the application of Delaware law and federal securities laws in the types of 
lawsuits to which each applies, the exclusive forum provisions may limit a  
stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing  
for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, stockholders, or    
other employees, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims  
against us and our current and former directors, officers, stockholders, or 
other employees. Our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our     
compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations   
thereunder as a result of our exclusive forum provisions. Further, in the   
event a court finds either exclusive forum provision contained in our       
amended and restated bylaws to be unenforceable or inapplicable in an       
action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action 
in other jurisdictions, which could harm our results of operations.         
                                                                        
  ITEM 2.  UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS  
                                                                        
Sales of Unregistered Securities From January 1, 2021 through March 31,     
2021, we granted to our employees, consultants, and other service providers 
options to purchase an aggregate of 254,200 shares of our Class A common    
stock under our 2011 Equity Incentive Plan at an exercise price of $27.03.  
From January 1, 2021 through March 31, 2021, we issued and sold to our      
employees, consultants, and other service providers an aggregate of         
1,232,156 shares of Class A common stock upon the exercise of options issued
under our 2011 Equity Incentive Plan at exercise prices ranging from $1.67  
to $27.03, for an aggregate exercise price of $9.4 million. None of the     
foregoing transactions involved any underwriters, underwriting discounts or 
commissions, or any public offering. We believe the offers, sales, and      
issuances of the above securities were exempt from registration under the   
Securities Act (or Regulation D or Regulation S promulgated thereunder) by  
virtue of Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act because the issuance of     
securities to the recipients did not involve a public offering, or in       
reliance on Rule 701 because the transactions were pursuant to compensatory 
benefit plans or contracts relating to compensation as provided under such  
rule. The recipients of the securities in each of these transactions        
represented their intentions to acquire the securities for investment only  
and not with a view to or for sale in connection with any distribution      
thereof, and appropriate legends were placed upon the stock certificates    
issued in these transactions. All recipients had adequate access, through   
their relationships with us, to information about us. The sales of these    
securities were made without any general solicitation or advertising. 72

On April 19, 2019, we exchanged a total of 150,307,622 shares of Class A
common stock held by Adam Foroughi, our co-founder, Chief Executive Officer,
and the Chairperson of our board of directors; Herald Chen, our President
and Chief Financial Officer, and a member of our board of directors; KKR
Denali Holdings L.P.; and certain affiliated trusts and entities for an
equivalent number of shares of Class B common stock pursuant to the terms of
an exchange agreement. No additional consideration was paid in connection
with the exchange. We believe the offers, sales, and issuances of the above
securities were exempt from registration under the Securities Act pursuant
to Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act because our securities were
exchanged by us with our existing security holders exclusively where no
commission or other remuneration was paid or given directly or indirectly
for soliciting such exchange.

On April 19, 2021, after the quarter end, we completed our initial public
offering (IPO), in which we sold 22,500,000 shares of our Class A common
stock and KKR Denali Holdings L.P. sold 2,500,000 shares of Class A common
stock at a price to the public of $80.00 per share. We received aggregate
net proceeds of $1.75 billion, net of underwriting discounts and commissions
of $47.2 million and offering expenses of $7.9 million subject to certain
cost reimbursements.

We utilized approximately $400.0 million of the net proceeds from our IPO to
repay the entire outstanding amount under our revolving credit facility. We
intend to use the net proceeds we received from our IPO for general
corporate purposes, including working capital, operating expenses and
capital expenditures. Additionally, we may use a portion of the net proceeds
we received from our IPO to enter into strategic acquisitions and
partnerships. The representatives of the underwriters of our IPO were Morgan
Stanley & Co. LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC. No payments were made by
us to directors, officers or persons owning ten percent or more of our
common stock or to their associates, or to our affiliates, other than
payments in the ordinary course of business to officers for salaries and to
non-employee directors pursuant to our director compensation policy.

There has been no material change in the planned use of the IPO proceeds as
described in our final prospectus filed with the SEC on April 15, 2021,
pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Securities Act.
