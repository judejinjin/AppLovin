   NOTE ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS                                    
                                                                            
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements
within the meaning of the federal securities laws, which statements involve
substantial risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements generally
relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In
some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain
words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,”
“could,” “intend,” “target,” “project,” “contemplate,” “believe,”
“estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue” or the negative of these
words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations,
strategy, plans, or intentions. Forward-looking statements contained in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include statements about:

• our future financial performance, including our expectations regarding our
revenue, cost of revenue, and operating expenses, and our ability to achieve
or maintain future profitability;

• the sufficiency of our cash and cash equivalents to meet our liquidity
needs;

• the demand for our Software Platform and Apps;

• our ability to attract and retain business clients and users;

• our ability to develop new products, features, and enhancements for our
Core Technologies and Software Platform and to launch or acquire new Apps
and successfully monetize them;

• our ability to compete with existing and new competitors in existing and
new markets and offerings;

• our ability to successfully acquire and integrate companies and assets and
to expand and diversify our operations through strategic acquisitions and
partnerships;

• our ability to maintain the security and availability of our Core
Technologies, Software Platform, and Apps;

• our expectations regarding the effects of existing and developing laws and
regulations, including with respect to taxation and privacy and data
protection;

• our ability to manage risk associated with our business;

• our expectations regarding new and evolving markets;

• our ability to develop and protect our brand;

• our expectations and management of future growth;

• our expectations concerning relationships with third parties;

We caution you that the foregoing list may not contain all of the forward-
looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future
events. We have based the forward-looking statements contained in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q primarily on our current expectations and
projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our
business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. The
outcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is
subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors, including those
described in the section titled “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive
and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from
time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all risks and
uncertainties that could have an impact on the forward-looking statements
contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We cannot assure you that
the results, events, and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking
statements will be achieved or occur, and actual results, events, or
circumstances could differ materially from those described in the forward-
looking statements.

Neither we nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and
completeness of any of these forward-looking statements. Moreover, the
forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q relate
only to events as of the date on which the statements are made. We undertake
no obligation to update any
                                     1                                      
Table of contents
forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to
reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q or to reflect new information or the occurrence of unanticipated
events, except as required by law. We may not actually achieve the plans,
intentions, or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements and
you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Our
forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any future
acquisitions, partnerships, mergers, dispositions, joint ventures, or
investments we may make.

In addition, statements that “we believe” and similar statements reflect our

   1. Description of Business and Principles of Consolidation               
                                                                            
Description of Business
AppLovin Corporation (the “Company” or “AppLovin”) was incorporated in the
state of Delaware on July 18, 2011. The Company is a leader in the mobile
app industry with a focus on building a software-based platform for mobile
app developers to improve the marketing and monetization of their apps. The
Company also has a globally diversified portfolio of apps—free-to-play
mobile games that it operates through its own or partner studios.

The Company’s operations are headquartered in Palo Alto, California, and has
several operating locations in the U.S. as well as various international
office locations in North America, Asia and Europe.
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have
been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles (“GAAP”) and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for interim financial reporting. Certain
information and footnote disclosures normally included in the financial
statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted
pursuant to such rules and regulations. Therefore, the unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in the
Company’s final prospectus related to its initial public offering ("IPO")
dated April 14, 2021 and filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b) under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The condensed consolidated balance
sheet data as of December 31, 2020 was derived from the audited consolidated
financial statements at that date but does not include all disclosures
required by GAAP. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal
recurring adjustments, that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for
the fair presentation of the Company’s financial position, results of
operations, cash flows and stockholders’ equity for the interim periods
presented. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2021 shown in this report are not necessarily indicative of
the results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2021 or any
other period.
Principles of Consolidation
The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect the
accounts of AppLovin Corporation and its subsidiaries in which the Company
has a controlling financial interest. In accordance with the provisions of
Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 810, Consolidation, the Company
consolidates any variable interest entity (“VIE”) of which the Company is
the primary beneficiary. The Company engages in business relationships with
certain entities in the ordinary course of business to develop game Apps.
The typical condition for a controlling financial interest ownership is
holding a majority of the voting interests of an entity; however, a
controlling financial interest may also exist in entities, such as VIEs,
through arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests. ASC
810 requires a variable interest holder to consolidate a VIE if that party
has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly
impact the VIE’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of
the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to
receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the
VIE. The Company does not consolidate a VIE in which it has a majority
ownership interest when the Company is not considered the primary
beneficiary. The Company evaluates its relationships with all VIEs on an
ongoing basis. All intercompany transactions and balances have been
eliminated upon consolidation.
Initial Public Offering and Capital Structure Change
The Company’s registration statement on Form S-1 (the “IPO Registration
Statement”) related to its IPO was declared effective on April 14, 2021, and
the Company’s Class A common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Select
Market on April 15, 2021. On April 19, 2021, the Company completed its IPO,
in which the Company sold 22,500,000shares of Class A common stock at price
to the public of $ 80.00per share. The Company received aggregate net
proceeds of $ 1.75billion after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions of $ 47.2million and offering expenses of $ 7.9million subject
to certain cost reimbursements. KKR Capital Markets LLC was an underwriter
for the IPO and is an affiliate of KKR Denali Holdings L.P. (“KKR Denali”),
who is a principal stockholder of the Company. The Company used $
400.0million of the net proceeds from the IPO to repay the entire
outstanding amount under the revolving credit facility (See Note 8). KKR
Capital Markets LLC is a lender under the revolving credit facility and an
affiliate of KKR Denali, a principal stockholder of the Company.

Following the effectiveness of the IPO Registration Statement, the Company
filed its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which became
effective immediately prior to the closing of the IPO (the “IPO
Certificate”). The IPO Certificate authorizes a total of 1,500,000,000shares
of Class A common stock, 200,000,000shares of Class B common stock,
150,000,000shares of Class C common stock, and 100,000,000shares of
preferred stock. Upon the filing and effectiveness of the IPO Certificate,
all shares of Class F common stock and Series A convertible preferred stock
then outstanding automatically converted into the equivalent number of
shares of Class A common stock, respectively (the “Capital Stock
Conversions”). Following the Capital Stock Conversions and immediately prior
to the completion of the IPO, a total of 150,307,622shares of Class A common
stock held by Adam Foroughi, the Company’s co-founder, CEO, and Chairperson;
Herald Chen, the Company’s President and Chief Financial Officer, and a
member of the Company’s board of directors; and KKR Denali (collectively
with certain affiliates, the Class B Stockholders) were exchanged for an
equivalent number of shares of Class B common stock pursuant to the terms of
certain exchange agreements. Following the closing of the IPO, the Company
had two classes of outstanding common stock: Class A common stock and Class
B common stock. Noshares of the Company’s Class C common stock or preferred
stock were issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2021.

The rights of the holders of all classes of stock pursuant to the IPO
Certificate are as follows:
Common Stock
The rights of the holders of Class A common stock, Class B common stock, and
Class C common stock (referred to together as the “common stock”) are
identical, except with respect to voting and conversion.
Voting Rights
Holders of the Class A common stock are entitled to onevote for each share
held on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, holders of the
Class B common stock are entitled to 20votes for each share held on all
matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, and holders of the Class C
common stock are not entitled to vote on any matter that is submitted to a
vote of stockholders, except as otherwise required by law. The holders of
the Class A common stock and Class B common stock will vote together as a
single class, unless otherwise required by law. Under the IPO Certificate,
approval of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of
the Class B common stock voting as a separate class will be required to
increase the number of authorized shares of the Class B common stock. In
addition, Delaware law could require either holders of the Class A common
stock, the Class B common stock, or the Class C common stock to vote
separately as a single class in the following circumstances:

• if the Company were to seek to amend the IPO Certificate to increase or
decrease the par value of a class of stock, then that class would be
required to vote separately to approve the proposed amendment; and

• if the Company were to seek to amend the IPO Certificate in a manner that
alters or changes the powers, preferences or special rights of a class of
stock in a manner that affected its holders adversely, then that class would
be required to vote separately to approve the proposed amendment.

Until the date on which the final conversion of all outstanding shares of
Class B common stock pursuant to the terms of the IPO Certificate occurs,
approval of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of the Company’s
Class B common stock voting as a separate class will be required to amend or
modify any provision of the IPO Certificate inconsistent with, or otherwise
alter, any provision of the IPO Certificate to modify the voting,
conversion, or other rights, powers, preferences, privileges, or
restrictions of the Company’s Class B common stock.

Upon the closing of the IPO, the Class B Stockholders held all of the issued
and outstanding shares of the Company’s Class B common stock. The Class B
Stockholders have entered into a voting agreement (the “Voting Agreement”)
whereby all Class B common stock held by the Class B Stockholders and their
respective permitted entities and permitted transferees will be voted as
determined by two of Mr. Foroughi, Mr. Chen, and KKR Denali (one of which
must be Mr. Foroughi).
Dividend Rights
Subject to preferences that may apply to any shares of preferred stock
outstanding at the time, the holders of the Company’s common stock will be
entitled to receive dividends out of funds legally available if the
Company’s board of directors, in its discretion, determines to issue
dividends and then only at the times and in the amounts that the Company’s
board of directors may determine.

No Preemptive or Similar Rights
The Company’s common stock will not be entitled to preemptive rights, and is
not subject to conversion, redemption or sinking fund provisions.
Right to Receive Liquidation Distributions
If the Company becomes subject to a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up,
the assets legally available for distribution to the Company’s stockholders
would be distributable ratably among the holders of the Company’s common
stock and any participating preferred stock outstanding at that time,
subject to prior satisfaction of all outstanding debt and liabilities and
the preferential rights of and the payment of liquidation preferences, if
any, on any outstanding shares of preferred stock.
Conversion of Class B Common Stock
Each share of Class B common stock will be convertible at any time at the
option of the holder into oneshare of Class A common stock. Following the
closing of the IPO, shares of Class B common stock will automatically
convert into shares of Class A common stock upon sale or transfer except for
certain transfers described in the IPO Certificate, including transfers for
estate planning, transfers among KKR Denali and its affiliates, or other
transfers among the Class B Stockholders. Withdrawal from the Voting
Agreement constitutes a transfer.

Each share of Class B common stock will convert automatically into oneshare
of Class A common stock upon the date fixed by the Company’s board of
directors that is no less than 61days and no more than 180days following the
date on which (i) the Voting Agreement is terminated or (ii) Adam Foroughi
is no longer involved with the Company as a member of the board of directors
or as an executive officer.
Conversion of Class C Common Stock
After the conversion or exchange of all outstanding shares of the Company’s
Class B common stock into shares of Class A common stock, all outstanding
shares of Class C common stock will convert automatically into Class A
common stock, on a share-for-share basis, on the date or time specified by
the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock,
voting as a separate class.
Preferred Stock
The Company’s IPO Certificate also authorizes the issuance of undesignated
preferred stock with rights and preferences, including voting rights,
designated from time to time by the board of directors.
                                                                            
  2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies                             
                                                                            
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
The Company generates Business and Consumer revenue. Business Revenue
includes fees paid by mobile app advertisers that use the Company’s software
platform (“Software Platform”), and revenue generated from the sale of
digital advertising inventory of the Company’s apps (“Apps”). Consumer
Revenue consists of mobile in-app purchases (“IAPs”) made by users within
Apps.
Business Revenue
The Software Platform provides the technology to match advertisers and
third-party owners of digital advertising inventory (“Publishers”) via
auctions at large scale and microsecond-level speeds. The pricing and terms
for all mobile advertising arrangements are governed by the Company’s terms
and conditions and generally stipulate payment terms of 30 days subsequent
to the end of the month. The contract is fully cancellable at any time.
For Business Revenue generated through placement of advertisements on mobile
applications owned by Publishers, the Company’s performance obligation is to
provide an advertiser with access to the Software Platform which facilitates
the advertiser’s purchase of advertising inventory from Publishers. The
Company does not control the advertising inventory prior to its transfer to
the advertiser, the Company’s customer, because the Company does not have
the substantive ability to direct the use of, nor obtain substantially all
of the remaining benefits from the advertising inventory. The Company is not
primarily responsible for fulfillment and does not have any inventory risk.
The Company is an agent as it relates to the sale of third-party advertising
inventory and presents revenue on a net basis. The transaction price is the
product of either the number of completions of agreed upon actions or
advertisements displayed and the contractually agreed upon price per
advertising unit with the advertiser less consideration paid or payable to
Publishers.
                                     12                                     
Table of contents
Advertisers purchase Apps advertising inventory either through the Software
Platform or through third-party advertising networks (“Ad Networks”).
Revenue from the sale of advertising inventory through Ad Networks is
recognized net of the amounts retained by Ad Networks as the Company is
unable to determine the gross amount paid by the advertisers to Ad Networks.

The Company recognizes mobile advertising revenue when the agreed upon
action is completed or when the ad is displayed to users, depending on the
agreed upon pricing mechanism with an advertiser or Ad Network. The number
of advertisements delivered and completions of agreed upon actions is
determined at the end of each month, which resolves any uncertainty in the
transaction price during the reporting period.
Consumer Revenue
IAPs include fees collected from users for the purchase of virtual goods to
enhance their gameplay experience. The identified performance obligation is
to provide users with the ability to acquire, use, and hold virtual items
over the estimated period of time the virtual items are available to the
user or until the virtual item is consumed. The Company categorizes its
virtual goods as either consumable or durable. Consumable virtual goods
represent goods that can be consumed by a specific player action in
gameplay; accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue from the sale of
consumable virtual goods as the goods are consumed and the Company’s
performance obligation is satisfied. Durable virtual goods represent goods
that are accessible to the user over an extended period of time;
accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue from the sale of durable virtual
goods ratably over the period of time the goods are available to the user
and the Company’s performance obligation is satisfied, which is generally
the estimated average user life (“EAUL”). Payment is required at the time of
purchase and the purchase price is a fixed amount. Users make IAPs through
the Company’s distribution partners. The transaction price is equal to the
gross amount charged to users because the Company is the principal in the
transaction. IAPs fees are non-refundable. Such payments are initially
recorded to deferred revenue.

The EAUL represents the Company’s best estimate of the expected life of
paying users for the applicable game. The EAUL begins when a user makes a
first purchase of durable virtual goods and ends when a user is determined
to be inactive. The Company determines the EAUL on a game-by-game basis. For
a newly launched game that has limited playing data, the Company determines
its EAUL based on the EAUL of a game that has sufficiently similar
characteristics. The Company determines the EAUL on a quarterly basis and
applies such calculated EAUL to all bookings in the respective quarter.
Determining the EAUL is subjective and requires management’s judgment.
Future playing patterns may differ from historical playing patterns, and
therefore the EAUL may change in the future. The EAULs are generally between
sixand nine months.

The Company presents taxes collected from customers and remitted to
governmental authorities on a net basis.
Asset Acquisitions and Business Combinations
The Company performs an initial test to determine whether substantially all
of the fair value of the gross assets transferred are concentrated in a
single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets, such
that the acquisition would not represent a business. If that test suggests
that the set of assets and activities is a business, the Company then
performs a second test to evaluate whether the assets and activities
transferred include inputs and substantive processes that together,
significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs, which would
constitute a business. If the result of the second test suggests that the
acquired assets and activities constitute a business, the Company accounts
for the transaction as a business combination.
For transactions accounted for as business combinations, the Company
allocates the fair value of acquisition consideration to the tangible assets
acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their
estimated fair values. Acquisition consideration includes the fair value of
any promised contingent consideration. The excess of the fair value of
acquisition consideration over the fair value of acquired identifiable
assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Contingent consideration is
remeasured to its fair value each reporting period with changes in the fair
value of contingent consideration recorded in general and administrative
expenses. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates
and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Management’s
estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be
reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and as a
result, actual results may differ from estimates. In certain circumstances,
the allocations of the excess purchase price are based upon preliminary
estimates and assumptions and subject to revision when the Company receives
final information, including appraisals and other analyses. During the
measurement period, which is one year from the acquisition date, the Company
may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with
the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the
                                     13                                     
Table of contents
measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.

For transactions accounted for as asset acquisitions, the cost, including
certain transaction costs, is allocated to the assets acquired on the basis
of relative fair values. The Company generally includes contingent
consideration in the cost of the assets acquired only when the uncertainty
is resolved. The Company recognizes contingent consideration adjustments to
the cost of the acquired assets prospectively using the straight-line method
over the remaining useful life of the assets. No goodwill is recognized in
asset acquisitions.
Services and Development Agreements
The Company enters into strategic agreements with mobile gaming studios
(“Partner Studios”). The Company has historically allowed these Partner
Studios to continue their operations with a significant degree of autonomy.
In some cases, the Company bought Apps from Partner Studios and entered into
service and development agreements whereby Partner Studios provide support
in improving existing Apps and developing new Apps. The substantial majority
of payments associated with service agreements for existing Apps are
expensed to research and development when the services are rendered as the
payments primarily relate to developing enhancements for the Apps. Payments
for new Apps associated with development agreements are generally made in
connection with the development of a particular App, and therefore, the
Company is subject to development risk prior to the release of the App.
Accordingly, payments that are due prior to completion of an App are
generally expensed to research and development over the development period
as the services are incurred. Payments due after completion of an App are
generally capitalized and expensed as cost of revenue. See Note 6,
“Acquisitions” for additional information.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements (Issued and Not Yet Adopted)
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible
Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity , to simplify the
accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of
liabilities and equity, including convertible instruments and contracts on
an entity’s own equity. The standard eliminates beneficial conversion
feature and cash conversion models resulting in more convertible instruments
being accounted for as a single unit; and simplifies classification of debt
on the balance sheet and earnings per share calculation. These changes will
become effective for the Company on January 1, 2022. The Company is
currently evaluating the potential impact of these changes.
In May 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-04, Issuer’s Accounting for Certain
Modifications or Exchanges of Freestanding Equity-Classified Written Call
Option. The ASU requires the issuers to account for modifications or
exchanges of freestanding equity-classified written call options that remain
equity classified after the modification or exchange based on the economic
substance of the modification or exchange. Under the guidance, an issuer
determines the accounting for the modification or exchange based on whether
the transaction was done to issue equity, to issue or modify debt, or for
other reasons. These changes will become effective for the Company on
January 1, 2022. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of
these changes.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements (Issued and Adopted)
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting
for Income Taxes. The ASU impacts various topic areas within ASC 740,
including accounting for taxes under hybrid tax regimes, accounting for
increases in goodwill, allocation of tax amounts to separate company
financial statements within a group that files a consolidated tax return,
intra period tax allocation, interim period accounting, and accounting for
ownership changes in investments, among other minor codification
improvements. The Company adopted this ASU on January 1, 2021 with no
material financial statement impact upon adoption.
In January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-01, Clarifying the Interactions
between Investments—Equity Securities, Investments—Equity Method and Joint
Ventures, and Derivatives and Hedging. This ASU clarifies the interaction
among the accounting standards for equity securities, equity method
investments and certain derivatives. The Company adopted this ASU on January
1, 2021 with no material financial statement impact upon adoption.

Convertible Security
In November 2020, the Company issued a convertible security as part of the
consideration exchanged for certain mobile game Apps acquired from an
independent foreign-based mobile game developer (the "Seller"). The Company
elected to account for the convertible security using the fair value option.
Under the fair value option, the financial liability is initially measured
at its issue-date estimated fair value and subsequently remeasured at
estimated fair value on a recurring basis at each reporting period date. The
fair value of the convertible security was determined using the probability-
weighted expected return method (“PWERM”). This valuation methodology is
based on unobservable estimates and judgements, and therefore is classified
as a Level 3 fair value measurement. The significant unobservable input used
in the fair value measurement of the convertible security is the expected
timing of occurrence of an IPO and a discount for lack of marketability
derived based on the remaining term of the lock up period related to the
Company's Class A common stock into which the convertible security is
convertible. Fair value measurements are highly sensitive to changes in this
input and significant changes in this input would result in a significantly
higher or lower fair value. For the three and nine months ended September
30, 2021, the Company recorded a total loss of $ 1.0million and $
3.5million, respectively, in other income (expense), net in the Company’s
condensed consolidated statements of operations due to the change in fair
value of the convertible security. The convertible security is recorded in
deferred acquisition costs, current, in the Company’s condensed consolidated
balance sheets. In August 2021, the Seller elected to convert 50% of the
convertible security with a stated value of $ 20.0million into 405,205shares
of the Company's Class A common stock at a conversion price of $ 49.4per
share. The lock-up period to which the Class A common stock was subject
expired during the three-month period ended September 30, 2021. As such, the
fair value of the related convertible security was transferred from Level 3
to Level 1.
Embedded Derivative
Loans issued under Company’s credit agreement with the lenders party thereto
and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent for the lenders (the
“Credit Agreement”), contain certain interest adjustment features which were
determined to be an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation and separate
accounting as the features are not clearly and closely related to the host
debt instrument. The embedded derivative was initially valued and remeasured
using the “with-and-without” method. The “with-and-without” methodology
involves valuing the whole instrument with and without the embedded
derivative using a discounted cash flow approach. The difference of the
estimated fair value between the instrument with the embedded derivative and
the instrument without the embedded derivative is the fair value of the
embedded derivative. This valuation methodology is based on unobservable
estimates and judgements, and therefore is classified as a Level 3 fair
value measurement. The significant unobservable input used in the fair value
measurement of the embedded derivative is the expected timing of occurrence
of an IPO. Fair value measurements are highly sensitive to changes in these
inputs and significant changes in these inputs would result in a
significantly higher or lower fair value. The initial fair value of the
embedded derivative was determined to be nominal for term loans issued prior
to 2021 and $ 5.6million for the term loans issued in February 2021, which
was accounted for as a reduction to the carrying amount of the term loans.
After the effectiveness of the IPO Registration Statement, the applicable
margins for both the Term Loans and the Revolving Credit Loans were reduced
by 0.25% on April 16, 2021 in accordance with the pre-existing terms of the
Credit Agreement. As a result, the embedded derivative for the contingent
interest adjustment feature related to the term loans was settled. The
Company remeasured the embedded derivative to its fair value of $
17.8million on the settlement date, and then reclassified it to the carrying
amount of the term loans. For the three and nine months ended September 30,
2021, the Company recorded a total gain of niland $ 7.6million,
respectively, in other income (expense), net in the Company’s condensed
consolidated statements of operations due to the change in fair value of the
embedded derivative. There was nogain or loss related to the change in fair
value of the embedded derivative during the same periods in 2020.
Marketable Equity Securities
The Company’s marketable equity securities consist entirely of its
investment in the ordinary shares of Huuuge, Inc., a foreign-based
independent mobile game developer, which completed its initial public
offering and became listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange in the first quarter
of 2021. The Company had carried the investment at cost in other assets on
the Company’s consolidated balance sheets in prior fiscal years. The cost
basis of the investment was immaterial. The fair value of the marketable
equity securities was based on the quoted market price of Huuuge, Inc.’s
ordinary shares as of September 30, 2021, and therefore was classified as a
Level 1 fair value measurement. For the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2021, the Company recorded a total unrealized gain of $
0.4million and $ 5.2million, respectively, in other income (expense), net in
the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of operations as a result of
remeasuring the investment to fair value.

Commitments

In May 2021, the Company amended a certain agreement with a cloud service
provider to increase the aggregate spend commitment from $ 130.0million to $
300.0million through May 2026.
Contingencies
From time to time, the Company may have certain contingent liabilities that
arise in the ordinary course of business activities. The Company accrues a
liability for such matters when it is probable that future expenditures will
be made, and such expenditures can be reasonably estimated.
Letters of Credit
As of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 the Company had outstanding
letters of credit in the aggregate amount of $ 11.1million, which were
issued as security for certain leased office facilities under the Credit
Agreement. These letters of credit have never been drawn upon.
Legal Proceedings
The Company is involved from time to time in litigation, claims, and
proceedings. The outcomes of the Company’s legal proceedings are inherently
unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainty.

The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been
incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If it is determined
that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be
estimated, the reasonably possible loss is disclosed. The Company evaluates
developments in legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that
has been previously accrued, and related reasonably possible losses
disclosed, and makes adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is
required to determine the likelihood of matters and the estimated amount of
losses related to such matters. To date, losses in connection with legal
proceedings have not been material.

The Company expenses legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.
Indemnifications
The Company enters into indemnification provisions under agreements with
other parties in the ordinary course of business, including certain
customers, business partners, investors, contractors and the Company’s
officers, directors and certain employees. It is not possible to determine
the maximum potential loss under these indemnification provisions due to the
Company’s limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique
facts and circumstances involved in each particular provision. To date,
losses recorded in the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of
operations in connection with the indemnification provisions have not been
material. As of September 30, 2021, the Company did not have any material
indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible.
Non-income Taxes
The Company may be subject to audit by various tax authorities with regard
to non-income tax matters. The subject matter of non-income tax audits
primarily arises from different interpretations on tax treatment and tax
rates
                                     17

applied. The Company accrues liabilities for non-income taxes that may
result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax
authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, and the
expense is recorded as a reduction of revenue or to general and
administrative expenses depending on the nature of the liability.

2021 Acquisitions

Business Combinations
On April 20, 2021, the Company acquired adjust GmbH (“Adjust”), a mobile
application tracking and analytics company. The Company purchased all of the
outstanding shares of the capital stock of Adjust and settled all of
Adjust’s debt for the stated purchase consideration of $ 980.0million, which
was composed of $ 352.0million stated value of convertible securities
convertible into a variable number of shares of the Company's Class A common
stock at a variable conversion price, $ 50.0million of cash holdback, and
remaining amount of $ 578.0million in cash consideration. The fair value of
the convertible securities and fair value of the cash holdback are estimated
to be $ 342.2million and $ 47.6million, respectively. As such, the fair
value of the acquisition consideration is determined to be $ 967.8million.
The transaction is expected to expand the Company’s Software solutions and
has been accounted for as a business combination. Transaction costs incurred
by the Company in connection with the acquisition, including professional
fees, were $ 3.1million.
The following table summarizes the preliminary allocation of the purchase
consideration to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities

The fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed are
based on management’s best estimates and assumptions as of the reporting
date. The Company has completed a preliminary valuation and expects to
finalize it as soon as practical, but no later than one year from the
acquisition date.

The income approach was used to determine the preliminary fair value of the
customer relationships, developed technology and tradename. Goodwill
represents the excess of the purchase price over the preliminary fair value
of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition
date and is primarily attributable to the assembled workforce and expected
synergies at the time of the acquisition. For tax purposes, an estimated tax
deductible goodwill of $ 692.5million was generated as a result of this
acquisition.

The Company’s condensed consolidated statement of operations for the nine
months ended September 30, 2021 includes Adjust’s revenue of $ 49.4million
and pretax loss of $ 29.6million for the period from the acquisition date of
April 20, 2021 to September 30, 2021.

In May 2021, the convertible securities were converted into 6,320,688shares

convertible securities was reclassified into the stockholders' equity.

Asset Acquisitions

In April 2021, the Company completed twoseparate transactions to acquire
certain mobile Apps from twoforeign-based independent mobile game developers
in exchange for an aggregate upfront cash consideration of $ 300.0million
and potential future earn-out payments. The Company incurred a total
transaction cost of $ 6.0million related to these transactions. Both
transactions were accounted for as asset acquisitions with $ 306.0million
allocated to the acquired mobile Apps, which will be amortized over
approximately eight years. Concurrent with the closings of these
transactions, the Company entered into a development services agreement with
each of the independent mobile game developers to support the acquired
mobile Apps, as well as to develop new mobile Apps during the four-yearterm
of the agreement. With respect to the first transaction, the potential
future earn-out payments are contingent on the revenue generated by the
acquired mobile Apps exceeding a certain revenue threshold, which will be
measured and payable (if applicable) each year for four yearsfrom the date
of the transaction. With respect to the second transaction, the potential
future earn-out payments will be determined in a manner similar to the first
transaction, in addition to a potential one-time earn-out payment of $
50.0million contingent on the achievement of a certain monthly revenue
milestone within the four yearsfollowing the date of the transaction.

In June 2021, the Company acquired certain mobile Apps from a foreign-based
independent mobile game developer in exchange for an upfront cash
consideration of $ 130.0million and future earn-out payments. The Company
incurred a total transaction cost of $ 4.0million related to the
transaction. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition with
$ 134.0million allocated to the acquired mobile Apps, which will be
amortized over nine years. Concurrent with the closing of the transaction,
the Company entered into a development services agreement with the
independent mobile game developer to support the acquired mobile Apps, as
well as to develop new mobile Apps during the four-yearterm of the
agreement. With respect to all initially acquired mobile Apps, the potential
future earn-out payments are contingent on the revenue and/or earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") generated
by the acquired mobile Apps exceeding certain thresholds.

In August 2021, the Company acquired certain mobile Apps from a foreign-
based independent mobile game developer in exchange for a total cash
consideration of $ 150.0million. The transaction was accounted for as an
asset acquisition with $ 150.0million allocated to the acquired mobile Apps,
which will be amortized over 6years.

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, the Company also
completed a number of other asset acquisitions for an aggregate upfront cash
consideration of $ 28.8million and $ 36.8million, respectively, as well as
potential future earn-out payments that are contingent on the revenue and/or
profit generated by the acquired mobile Apps.

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, the Company
recognized total earn-out costs of $ 9.9million and $ 97.5million,
respectively, of which $ 0.7million and $ 68.6million were related to an
asset acquisition closed in 2020. These earn-out costs increased the book
value of the acquired mobile Apps, and are amortized over the remaining
useful life of the originally acquired mobile Apps.

In January 2021 the Company paid $ 60.0million to Recoded, an independent
foreign-based mobile game developer, in relation to a new mobile App
acquired in 2020. In February 2021, the Company paid an additional $
90.0million to Recoded related to deferred cash consideration for the
acquisition that closed in 2019.
2020 Acquisitions

Business Combinations
Geewa —On January 31, 2020, the Company acquired Geewa A.S. (“Geewa”), a
privately held company specializing in mobile gaming. The transaction
expanded the Company’s Apps portfolio and was accounted for as a business
combination. The Company purchased all of the outstanding shares of the
capital stock of Geewa for a total consideration of $ 25.6million, of which
$ 23.5million was paid in cash and the unpaid balance was attributed to a $
2.1million indemnity holdback that was paid in January 2021. Transaction
costs incurred by the Company in connection with the acquisition, including
professional fees, were $ 0.3million.

Redemption Games— On April 6, 2020, the Company acquired Redemption Games,
Inc. (“Redemption Games”), a privately held company specializing in mobile
gaming. The transaction expanded the Company’s Apps portfolio and was
accounted for as a business combination. As part of the transaction, the
Company purchased 95.5% of the outstanding shares of the capital stock of
Redemption Games for an aggregate total consideration of $ 53.7million.
Based on the consideration paid and the percent acquired, the transaction
implied a total value for Redemption of $ 56.2million. Transaction costs
incurred by the Company in connection with the acquisition, including
professional fees, were $ 0.6million. In November 2020, the Company
increased its ownership in Redemption Games to 98.2% by exchanging 2.7% of
minority shares for the Company’s Class A common stock. The difference
between the $ 4.5million in fair value of the Class A common stock issued
and the $ 1.5million in fair value of the minority shares was recognized as
stock-based compensation in research and development expenses.

Machine Zone, Inc.— On May 19, 2020, the Company acquired Machine Zone, Inc.
(“Machine Zone”), a privately held company specializing in mobile gaming.
The transaction expanded the Company’s Apps portfolio and was accounted for
as a business combination. The Company purchased all of the outstanding
shares of the capital stock of Machine Zone and settled all Machine Zone
debt for an aggregate acquisition price of $ 328.6million comprising $
287.1million cash paid to Machine Zone lenders, common stock warrants issued
to Machine Zone lenders and preferred stockholders with the aggregate fair
value of $ 38.2million and a settlement of the preexisting accounts
receivable balance of $ 3.3million. Transaction costs incurred by the
Company in connection with the acquisition, including professional fees,
were $ 2.8million.

The Company also assumed an intellectual property license agreement with a
third-party game content provider that was included in the Machine Zone
acquisition. The term of the intellectual property license agreement is set
to expire in December 2021 with the option to renew for additional terms by
the mutual agreement of the parties. The remaining future fixed payments
under the intellectual property license agreement as of the date of the
Machine Zone acquisition amounted to $ 37.1million.

The income approach was used to value the developed Apps and tradename. The
replacement cost approach was used to value the intellectual property
license asset. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the
fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the
acquisition date and is primarily attributable to the assembled workforce
and expected synergies at the time of the acquisition. Goodwill is
deductible for tax purposes.

Contemporaneously with the closing of the acquisition, the Company exited
from oneof Machine Zone’s real estate leases. The Company accounted for this
lease termination as a transaction separate from the business combination
since the lease termination was negotiated primarily for the benefit of the
combined entity; the Company was the party who directly negotiated this
lease amendment with the lessor; and such negotiation took place
contemporaneously with the negotiation of the business combination. The
Company decreased the operating lease right-of-use asset and operating lease
liability by $ 57.6million and $ 63.1million, respectively. The Company also
wrote-off $ 15.0million of leasehold improvements and other assets related
to this real estate lease. In connection with this transaction, the Company
issued a common stock warrant with the fair value of $ 0.4million.

The Company’s consolidated statements of operations for the nine months
ended September 30, 2020 includes Machine Zone’s revenue of $ 64.2million
and pretax loss of $ 66.2million for the period from the acquisition date of
May 19, 2020 to September 30, 2020.

Asset Acquisitions

Zenlife asset acquisition —In June 2020, the Company acquired certain mobile
Apps from an independent foreign-based mobile game developer in exchange for
an upfront cash consideration of $ 160.0million and future earn-out payments
for each of the four yearsfrom the date of the transaction based on the
excess, if any, of
                                     21                                     
Table of contents
revenue generated by the initially acquired mobile App for such year above
the sum of (i) an annual fixed baseline revenue and (ii) the aggregate earn-
out payments made in prior years. The transaction was accounted for as an
asset acquisition with $ 173.3million allocated to the acquired mobile Apps
and $ 13.3million to deferred tax liability. The recorded value of acquired
mobile Apps is amortized over five years. Additionally, the Company entered
into a service and development agreement with the independent mobile game
developer to support the initially acquired mobile Apps as well as to
develop new mobile Apps during the four-yearterm of the agreement. The
Company is also required to make future earn-out payments for newly
developed mobile Apps determined under the similar approach as for the
initially acquired mobile Apps.

In March and April 2020, the Company completed twoasset acquisitions to
acquire twomobile Apps from twoseparate independent foreign-based mobile
game developers in exchange for an aggregate upfront cash consideration of $
35.0million and future earn-out payments. Both transactions were accounted
for as asset acquisitions with $ 35.0million allocated to the acquired
mobile Apps, which will be amortized over threeand five years. Additionally,
the Company entered into service and development agreements with the
independent mobile game developers to support the initially acquired mobile
Apps as well as to develop new mobile Apps. With respect to the first asset
acquisition, future earn-out payments are based on a predetermined
percentage of revenue net of certain direct costs generated by the initially
acquired mobile App, or additional mobile Apps developed under the service
and development agreement, over the term of the agreement, which is
initially two years, but which may renew for an additional two-yearterm.
With respect to the second asset acquisition, future earn-out payments for
each of the four yearsfrom the date of the transaction are based on (i)(a)
the revenue generated by the initially acquired mobile App and any
additional mobile Apps developed under the service and development agreement
over the term of four yearsin excess of (b) a baseline revenue threshold,
multiplied by (ii) tiered revenue multiples, up to a cumulative amount of $
45.0million.

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, the Company
recognized total earn-out costs of $ 12.4million and $ 26.1million,
respectively, related to all acquired mobile Apps. These earn-out costs
increased the book value of the acquired mobile Apps, and are amortized over
the remaining useful life of the originally acquired mobile Apps.

Modification of asset acquisition-related contingent consideration —In
September 2020, the Company amended the terms of an asset acquisition to
settle the acquisition holdback and the earn-out due to the sellers 12
months following the acquisition’s closing in 2019. Under the terms of the
amendment, the Company agreed to settle a $ 34.8million liability related to
an acquisition holdback and earn-out, with a combination of a cash payment
of $ 3.4million and the Company’s Class A common stock at the fair value of
$ 106.1million as of the settlement date, resulting in a $ 74.7million
extinguishment loss of the acquisition-related contingent consideration.

  8. Credit Agreement                                                       
                                                                            
On August 15, 2018, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement which
provided for senior secured term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $
820.0million (the “Closing Term Loans”) and a revolving credit facility of $
50.0million.

On April 23, 2019, the Credit Agreement was amended to increase the senior
secured term loan facility by $ 400.0million, on terms identical to those
applicable to the Closing Term Loans (together with the Closing Term Loans,
the “Initial Term Loans”).

On April 27, 2020, the Credit Agreement was further amended to modify
certain negative covenants.

On May 6, 2020, the Credit Agreement was further amended (the “Third
Amendment”) to increase the senior secured term loan facility by an
additional $ 300.0million (the “Third Amendment Term Loans”).

On October 27, 2020, the Credit Agreement was further amended to increase
the aggregate principal amount of the revolving credit facility by an
additional $ 540.0million.

On November 30, 2020, the Company borrowed $ 150.0million under the
revolving credit facility.

On February 12, 2021, the Company amended the Credit Agreement to 1)
increase the senior secured term loan facility by an aggregate principal
amount of $ 597.8million (the “Fifth Amendment Term Loans”, and together
with the Initial Term Loans, the “Term Loans”), on terms identical to those
applicable to the existing Initial Term Loans, the proceeds of which was
partially used to repay in full the outstanding principal and accrued and
unpaid interest of the Third Amendment Term Loans, totaling $ 298.2million,
in accordance with the pre-existing early redemption option in the Credit
Agreement, and 2) increase the aggregate principal amount of the revolving
credit facility by an additional $ 10.0million, on terms identical to those
applicable to the existing revolving credit facility. According to the
amended Credit Agreement, the Company is required to make equal quarterly
repayments of $ 4.6million with respect to the Term Loans. In connection
with this amendment, the Company paid $ 0.8million in fees to KKR Capital
Markets LLC, who is affiliated with KKR Denali, one of the Company’s
principal stockholders.

The Company evaluated the accounting for the Fifth Amendment Term Loans on a
creditor-by-creditor basis. For existing creditors who participated in the
Fifth Amendment Term Loans, the transaction was accounted for as a debt
modification because the present value of the cash flows between the two
debt instruments before and after the transaction was less than 10%. For new
creditors, the transaction was accounted for as an issuance of new debt. As
a result, $ 2.9million of the $ 3.5million third-party issuance costs
related to the modified debt was recorded in other income (expense), net on
the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three
months ended March 31, 2021, with the remaining $ 0.6million related to the
new debt recorded as a reduction to the carrying amount of the Term Loans.
In addition, the Company recorded $ 5.6million for an embedded derivative
related to the contingent interest adjustment feature of the Fifth Amendment
Term Loans, which was bifurcated and accounted for separately as the feature
is not clearly and closely related to the host instrument. For details
regarding the fair value measurement of the embedded derivative, see Note 4.
The debt discount, comprising of 1) the deferred third-party issuance costs,
2) the bifurcated embedded derivative and 3) the debt discount of the
Initial Term Loans that were modified as part of the amendment, is being
amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the
remaining contractual term of the Term Loans.

The Company accounted for the early repayment of the Third Amendment Term
loans as a debt extinguishment. As a result, the Company recognized a loss
on debt extinguishment of $ 16.9million during the three months ended March
31, 2021, which was recorded in interest expense and loss on extinguishment
of debt on the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of operations.
The loss on debt extinguishment consisted primarily of the unamortized
original issue discount and debt issuance cost.
                                     24

On March 31, 2021, the Company drew down an additional $ 250.0million from
the Company’s $ 600.0million revolving credit facility. A lender under the
revolving credit facility is an affiliate of KKR Denali, a principal
stockholder of the Company. Following such draw down, the Company had an
aggregate amount of $ 400.0million outstanding under the revolving credit
facility, which was repaid in full with the net proceeds from the IPO in
April 2021.

After the effectiveness of the IPO Registration Statement, the applicable
margins for both the Term Loans and the Revolving Credit Loans were reduced
by 0.25% on April 16, 2021 in accordance with the pre-existing terms of the
Credit Agreement. As a result, the embedded derivative for the contingent
interest adjustment feature related to the Term Loans was settled. The
Company remeasured the embedded derivative to its fair value of $
17.8million on the settlement date by recording a gain of $ 1.1million in
other income (expense), net in the Company’s condensed consolidated
statements of operations, and then reclassified it to the carrying amount of
the Term Loans as an additional debt discount. The new unamortized discount
balance is subsequently amortized using the new effective interest rate
determined on the settlement date of the embedded derivative.

As of September 30, 2021, the Company was in compliance with all of the
covenants.
                                                                            
  9. Cash Flow Hedges                                                       
                                                                            
The Company manages exposure to market risk associated with fluctuating
interest rates with the use of interest rate derivative financial
instruments, namely interest rate swaps. The Company does not use
derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. On November 14, 2018, the
Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement as part of its interest
rate risk management strategy in connection with the term loan. The notional
amount for the swap was $ 410.0million. The swap was a receive-variable
(one-month LIBOR) and pay-fixed ( 2.9065%) interest rate swap with
settlement date commencing on the last calendar day of each month and reset
date on first day of each month beginning December 31, 2018.

The Company applied the hedge accounting provisions of the critical terms
match hedge, and formally documented at inception all relationships between
hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management
objectives and strategies for undertaking the various hedges. The critical
terms of the swap and hedged item coincided (notional amount, interest rate
reset dates, interest rate payment dates, and underlying index), the hedge
was expected to offset changes in expected cash flows due to fluctuations in
one-month LIBOR over the term of the hedge. Therefore, the effectiveness of
the hedge relationship was assessed each quarter by comparing the current
terms of the swap and the debt to assure they continued to coincide and
through an evaluation of the continued ability of the counterparty to the
swap to honor its obligations under the swap. Had the critical terms no
longer matched exactly, hedge effectiveness (both prospective and
retrospective) would have to be assessed by evaluating the cumulative
dollar-offset ratio for the actual derivative and the hedged item.

Unrealized changes in the fair value of derivatives accounted for as a
critical term match hedge were reported in other comprehensive income (loss)
and subsequently reclassified to earnings in the same period or periods
during which the hedged forecasted transaction affected earnings. The
interest rate swap contract expired on December 31, 2020 and the settlement
value of the interest rate swap liability was reclassified to interest
expense and loss on settlement of debt. For the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2020, the Company recognized $ 2.9million and $ 6.7million of
realized loss related to hedged transaction, respectively, which were
recorded in interest expense and loss on settlement of debt in the Company’s
condensed consolidated statements of operations. As of September 30, 2020,
the settlement value of the interest rate swap liability before tax effect
was $ 2.9million and was included in accrued liabilities and reported in
other comprehensive income net of tax effect.
                                                                            
  10. Stock-based Compensation                                              
                                                                            
In March 2021, the Company’s board of directors adopted, and its

Early Exercise of Stock Options —The 2011 Plan allowed, subject to the
Board's approval for the early exercise of options granted. Under the terms
of the 2011 Plan, option holders, upon early exercise, must sign a
restricted stock purchase agreement that gives the Company the right to
repurchase any unvested shares, at the original exercise price, in the event
the optionees’ employment terminates for any reason. The right to exercise
options before they are vested does not change existing vesting schedules in
any way and the early exercised options may not be sold or transferred
before they are vested. The repurchase right lapses over time as the shares
vest at the same rate as the original option vesting schedule. The cash
amounts received in exchange for these early exercised shares are recorded
as a liability on the accompanying balance sheets and reclassified into
common stock and additional paid-in-capital as the shares vest. The
Company’s right to repurchase these shares lapses by 1/4th of the shares on
the one yearanniversary of the vesting start date and ratably each month
over the next 36months. The Company has 879,600and 19,800shares of Class A
common stock subject to repurchase as of September 30, 2021 and December 31,
2020, respectively. The liability for the shares of Class A common stock
subject to repurchase as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 was $
2.4million and $ 0.1million, respectively, which was included in the accrued
liabilities in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets.

During 2020 and 2019, the Company provided financing to certain employees in
the form of promissory notes to early exercise stock options. These
promissory notes are partially collateralized by shares and, for accounting
purposes, in-substance are nonrecourse. For accounting purposes, exercised
options via nonrecourse promissory notes are not substantive and are
continued to be treated as options. In February 2021, promissory notes
issued to executive officers in the amount of $ 20.9million were settled
through either share repurchase, in the amount of $ 17.2million, or cash
payment, in the amount of $ 3.7million. In connection with the repurchase of
shares, the Company accelerated vesting of 60,968shares of Class A common
stock for one of the Company’s officers. The acceleration of vesting was
accounted as an option modification with an immaterial impact to the stock-
based compensation expense. As of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020,
the Company had 2,884,999and 8,022,499shares of Class A common stock
options, respectively, that were exercised via nonrecourse promissory notes,
of which 841,563and 4,136,677shares, were unvested and subject to
repurchase, respectively. The principal balances of nonrecourse promissory
notes outstanding amounted to $ 15.1million and $ 40.4million as of
September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.
                                                                            
  11. Net Income (Loss) Per Share                                           
                                                                            
Basic and diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to common
stockholders is computed in conformity with the two-class method required
for participating securities. The Company considers its convertible
preferred stock, options exercised in exchange for nonrecourse promissory
notes, early exercised unvested stock options and unvested restricted stock
awards to be participating securities. Under the two-class method, the net
loss attributable to common stockholders is not allocated to convertible
preferred stock, options exercised in exchange for nonrecourse promissory
notes, early exercised unvested common stock options and unvested restricted
stock awards as the holders of these instruments do not have a contractual
obligation to share in the Company’s losses. Net income is attributed to
common stockholders and participating securities based on their
participation rights. Basic net loss per share attributable to common
stockholders is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common
stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share attributable to
common stockholders adjusts basic earnings per share for the potentially
dilutive impact of stock options.

  12. Income Taxes                                                          
                                                                            
The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in foreign
jurisdictions. The Company bases its interim tax accruals on an estimated
annual effective tax rate applied to year-to-date income and record the
discrete tax items in the period to which they relate. In each quarter, the
Company updates its estimated annual effective tax rate and makes a year-to-
date adjustment to its tax provision as necessary. The Company’s calendar
year 2021 annual effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate
primarily due to net excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation,
foreign derived intangible income deduction, valuation allowance against
losses which cannot be realized and the foreign tax rate differential.

On March 11, 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act (“ARPA”) was enacted. The
ARPA contains numerous income tax provisions, such as expanding the
definition of covered employees. The ARPA has no impact on the income tax
provision (benefit) for the nine months ended September 30, 2021.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2021, there were no material
changes to the Company's unrecognized tax benefits, and the Company does not
expect material changes in its unrecognized tax benefits within the next
twelve months.

  14. Subsequent Events                                                     
                                                                            
In October 2021, the remaining 50% of the convertible security with a stated
value of $ 20.0million was converted into 324,156shares of the Company's

acquire from Twitter, Inc. the MoPub business for approximately $
1.05billion in cash. The transaction is subject to customary closing
conditions and is expected to close in 2022.

On October 25, 2021, the Company amended the Credit Agreement to increase
the senior secured term loan facility by an aggregate principal amount of $
1.50billion. In connection with this amendment, the Company paid $
1.4million in fees to KKR Capital Markets LLC, who is affiliated with KKR

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results
of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated
financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our final prospectus related to our
initial public offering, or IPO, dated April 14, 2021. This discussion
contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those
identified below and those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors”
and other parts of this Form 10-Q. Our historical results are not
necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in
the future.
                                                                            
   Overview                                                                 
                                                                            
Our mission is to grow the mobile app ecosystem by enabling the success of
mobile app developers. Our software solutions provide advanced tools for
mobile app developers to grow their businesses by automating and optimizing
the marketing and monetization of their apps. Since inception, our platform
has driven over six billion mobile app installs for mobile app developers.
Our software, coupled with our deep industry knowledge and expertise, has
allowed us to rapidly scale a successful and diversified portfolio of owned
mobile apps. We have also accelerated our market penetration through an
active acquisition and partnership strategy. Our scaled and integrated
business model sits at the nexus of the mobile app ecosystem, which creates
a durable competitive advantage that has fueled our clients’ success and our
strong growth.

Since our founding in 2011, we have been focused on building a software-
based platform for mobile app developers to improve the marketing and
monetization of their apps. Our founders, who are mobile app developers
themselves, quickly realized the real impediment to success and growth in
the mobile app ecosystem was a discovery and monetization problem—breaking
through the congested app stores to efficiently find users and successfully
grow their business. Their first-hand experience with these developer
challenges led to the development of our infrastructure and
software—AppLovin Core Technologies and AppLovin Software Platform. We
capitalized on our success and understanding of the mobile app ecosystem by
launching AppLovin Apps in 2018. Our Apps now consist of a globally
diversified portfolio of over 350 free-to-play mobile games across five
genres, run by eighteen studios.

For the three months ended September 30, 2021, our revenue grew 90% year-
over-year, from $381.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020
to $727.0 million in the comparative period in 2021. We generated a net
income of $0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021, and a
net loss of $89.9 million in the comparative period in 2020. We generated
Adjusted EBITDA of $190.7 million, and $84.3 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Additionally, we have
generated strong cash flows, with net cash provided by operating activities
of $276.8 million and $122.7 million in the nine months ended September 30,
2021 and 2020, respectively. This has allowed us to reinvest in our
expansion and growth and consummate strategic acquisitions and partnerships.
See the section titled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a definition of
Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income
(loss), the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in
accordance with GAAP.

We collect revenue from two sources—business clients and consumers. During
the three months ended September 30, 2021, Business Revenue represented
48.1% of total revenue and Consumer Revenue represented 51.9% of total
revenue.

We generate Business Revenue from fees paid by mobile app advertisers, or
business clients, that use our Software Platform to grow and monetize their
apps. We also collect Business Revenue from business clients that purchase
the digital advertising inventory of our portfolio of Apps. We are able to
grow our Business Revenue by improving our Software Platform, adding more
apps to our Apps portfolio and increasing engagement on our existing Apps.

Business clients include a wide variety of advertisers, from indie developer
studios to some of the largest global internet platforms, such as Facebook
and Google. While we have thousands of business clients as of September 30,
2021, the vast majority of our revenue is derived from our Enterprise
Clients and Software Platform Enterprise Clients. See “Key Metrics” below
for additional information on how we calculate Enterprise Clients and
Software Platform Enterprise Clients. Approximately 96% of our Business
Revenue for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 came from our 325
Enterprise Clients. Our Enterprise Clients had a Net Dollar-Based
                                     30

Retention Rate of approximately 176% for the twelve months ended September
30, 2021 1 . We see multiple opportunities to gain new business clients, and
to increase spend from existing business clients, as we help them grow their
businesses and make them more successful. Business Revenue from our Apps was
44.7% of total Business Revenue in the three months ended September 30,
2021.

Our Software Platform includes AppDiscovery, Adjust and MAX. Business
clients use AppDiscovery to automate, optimize, and manage their user
acquisition investments. They set marketing and user growth goals, and
AppDiscovery optimizes their ad spend in an effort to achieve their return
on advertising spend targets and other marketing objectives. AppDiscovery
comprises the vast majority of revenue from our Software Platform. Revenue
is generated from our advertisers, typically on a performance-based, cost-
per-install basis, and shared with our advertising publishers, typically on
a cost per impression model. Approximately 92% of our Business - Software
Platform Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2021 came from our
449 Software Platform Enterprise Clients. Our Software Platform Enterprise
Clients had a Net Dollar-Based Retention Rate of approximately 255% for the
three months ended September 30, 2021 2 .

Business clients use Adjust's SaaS mobile marketing platform to better
understand their users' journey while allowing marketers to make smarter
decisions through measurement, attribution and fraud prevention. Revenue
from Adjust is primarily generated from an annual software subscription fee.

Business clients use MAX to optimize purchases of app ad inventory. The
Compass Analytics tool within MAX provides insights to manage against key
performance indicators, understand the long-term value of users, and help
manage profitability. Revenue from MAX is generated based on a percentage of
client spend. As more developers move to in-app bidding monetization, we
expect growth in the adoption of, and revenue from, MAX.

Business clients that purchase advertising inventory from our Apps are able
to target highly relevant users from our diverse and global portfolio of
over 350 mobile games. Our clients leverage a broad set of high-performing
mobile ad formats, including playable and rewarded video, and are able to
match these ads with relevant users resulting in a better return on their
advertising spend. By increasing the number of users and their engagement,
as well as better matching ads with the appropriate target audience, we are
able to increase our revenue from business clients that purchase advertising
inventory from our Apps. Revenue from business clients related to our Apps
is generated from ads purchased by advertisers, as well as from revenue-
sharing agreements between some of our studios and a selection of third-
party studios for which they publish and monetize games.
                                                                            
  Consumer Revenue                                                          
                                                                            
Consumer Revenue is generated when a user of one of our Apps makes an in-app
purchase (IAP). Our Apps are generally free-to-play mobile games and
generate Consumer Revenue through IAPs. IAPs consist of virtual goods used
to enhance gameplay, accelerate access to certain features or levels, and
augment other mobile game progression opportunities for the user. IAPs drive
more engagement and better economics from our Apps. The vast majority of our
IAP revenue flows through two app stores, Apple App Store and Google Play,
which charge us a standard commission on IAPs.

During the three months ended September 30, 2021, we had an average of 2.9
million Monthly Active Payers (MAPs) across our portfolio of Apps. Over that
period, we had an Average Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP) of $44.
Leveraging the benefit of our integrated Platform and Apps, we see
opportunities to grow our App-related revenue streams by increasing MAPs and
expanding ARPMAP within existing games and through new game development,
acquisitions and partnerships. See “Key Metrics” below for additional
information on how we calculate MAPs and ARPMAP.
1 We measure Net Dollar-Based Retention Rate for the twelve months ended
September 30, 2021 for our Enterprise Clients as current period revenue
divided by prior period revenue. Prior period revenue is measured as revenue
for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020 from our Enterprise Clients
as of September 30, 2020. Current period revenue is revenue for the twelve
months ended September 30, 2021 from our Enterprise Clients as of September
30, 2021, and excludes revenue from any new Enterprise Clients during the
twelve months ended September 30, 2021.

2 We measure Net Dollar-Based Retention Rate for the three months ended
September 30, 2021 for our Software Platform Enterprise Clients as current
period revenue divided by prior period revenue. Prior period revenue is
measured as revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2020 from our
Software Platform Enterprise Clients as of September 30, 2020. Current
period revenue is revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2021 from
Software Platform Enterprise Clients as of September 30, 2020.

We review the following key metrics on a regular basis in order to evaluate
the health of our business, identify trends affecting our performance,
prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions.
Annual Key Metrics

Enterprise Clients. We focus on the number of Enterprise Clients, which are
third-party business clients from whom we have collected greater than
$125,000 of revenue in the trailing 12 months to a given date. Enterprise
Clients generate the vast majority of our Business Revenue and Business
Revenue growth. We expect to increase the revenue from Enterprise Clients
over time.

Revenue Per Enterprise Client (RPEC). We define RPEC as (i) the total
revenue derived from our Enterprise Clients in a twelve- month period,
divided by (ii) Enterprise Clients as of the end of that same period. RPEC
shows how efficiently we are monetizing each Enterprise Client. We expect to
increase RPEC over time as we enhance our Software Platform and Apps.

Quarterly Key Metrics
Software Platform Enterprise Clients. We focus on the number of Software
Platform Enterprise Clients, which are third-party business clients from
whom we have collected greater than $31,250 of Software Platform revenue in
the three months to a given date, equating to an annual run-rate of $125,000
in revenue. Software Platform Enterprise Clients generate the vast majority
of our Business Revenue - Software Platform and Business Revenue - Software
Platform growth.

Revenue Per Software Platform Enterprise Client (Revenue per SPEC) . We
define Revenue per SPEC as (i) the total revenue derived from our Software
Platform Enterprise Clients in a three-month period, divided by (ii)
Software Platform Enterprise Clients as of the end of that same period.
Revenue per SPEC shows how efficiently we are monetizing each SPEC. We
expect to increase Revenue per SPEC over time as we enhance our Software
Platform and Apps.

Total Software Transaction Value ("TSTV"). Business Software Platform
revenue is from third-party clients using our Software Platform to find new
customers. We do not recognize revenue from our own spend on our Software
Platform. Therefore, we use TSTV to measure the scale and growth rates of
our Software Platform, as it reflects the total value on our Software
Platform including our first-party studios as though they were stand-alone
businesses.

Monthly Active Payers (MAPs). We define a MAP as a unique mobile device
active on one of our Apps in a month that completed at least one IAP during
that time period. A consumer who makes IAPs within two separate Apps on the
same mobile device in a monthly period will be counted as two MAPs. MAPs for
a particular time period longer than one month are the average MAPs for each
month during that period. We estimate the number of MAPs by aggregating
certain data from third-party attribution partners. Some of our Apps do not
utilize such third-party attribution partners, and therefore our MAPs figure
for any period does not capture every user that completed an IAP on our
Apps. We estimate that our counted MAPs generated approximately 98% of our
Consumer Revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2021, and as
such, management believes that MAPs are still a useful metric to measure the
engagement and monetization potential of our games. We expect to increase
our MAPs over time as we increase the number of our Apps and enhance the
engagement and monetization of our Apps.

Average Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer (ARPMAP). We define ARPMAP as (i)
the total Consumer Revenue derived from our Apps in a monthly period,
divided by (ii) MAPs in that same period. ARPMAP for a particular time
period longer than one month is the average ARPMAP for each month during
that period. ARPMAP shows how efficiently we are monetizing each MAP. We
expect to increase ARPMAP over time as we enhance the monetization of our
Apps.

Monthly Active Payer for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020.

Our key metrics are not based on any standardized industry methodology and
are not necessarily calculated in the same manner or comparable to similarly
titled measures presented by other companies. Similarly, our key metrics may
differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled
metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology. The numbers
that we use to calculate TSTV, MAP, and ARPMAP are based on internal data.
While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable judgments
and estimates for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent
challenges in measuring usage and engagement. We regularly review and may
adjust our processes for calculating our internal metrics to improve their
accuracy.

  Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin                                
                                                                            
We define Adjusted EBITDA for a particular period as net income (loss)
before interest expense and loss on settlement of debt, other (income)
expense, net (excluding certain recurring items), provision for (benefit
from) income taxes, amortization, depreciation and write-offs and as further
adjusted for stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense
and transaction bonus, loss (gain) on extinguishments of acquisition related
continent consideration, non-operating foreign exchange losses, lease
modification and abandonment of leasehold improvements, and change in the
fair value of contingent consideration. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as
Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the same period.

Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are key measures we use to assess
our financial performance and are also used for internal planning and
forecasting purposes. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin
are helpful to investors, analysts, and other interested parties because
they can assist in providing a more consistent and comparable overview of
our operations across our historical financial periods. In addition, these
measures are frequently used by analysts, investors, and other interested
parties to evaluate and assess performance. We use Adjusted EBITDA and
Adjusted EBITDA margin in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of
                                     33

our overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation of our
annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the
effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our board
of directors concerning our financial performance.

Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are non-GAAP financial measures
and are presented for supplemental informational purposes only and should
not be considered as alternatives or substitutes to financial information
presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures have certain limitations
in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are
reflected in our consolidated statement of operations that are necessary to
run our business. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by
other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition,
other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Furthermore, these
metrics have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of
certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of
operations that are necessary to run our business. Thus, our Adjusted EBITDA
and Adjusted EBITDA margin should be considered in addition to, not as
substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with
GAAP.

  Factors Affecting Our Performance                                         
                                                                            
We believe that the future success of our business depends on many factors,
including the factors described below. While each of these factors presents
significant opportunities for our business, they also pose important
challenges that we must successfully address in order to continue to grow
profitably while maintaining strong cash flow.
                                                                            
  Continue to invest in innovation                                          
                                                                            
We have made, and intend to continue to make, significant investments in our
Core Technologies and Software Platform to enhance their effectiveness and
value proposition for our business clients. We expect that these investments
will require spending on research and development, and acquisitions and
partnerships related to technology components and products. We believe
investments in our Core Technologies, such as our launch of AXON and
acquisition of MAX, will further improve their effectiveness for developers.
Our investments will also allow us to enter new mobile app sectors outside
of gaming. While our investments in research and development and
acquisitions and partnerships may not result in revenue in the near term, we
believe these investments position us to increase our revenue over time.

   Retain and grow existing business clients                                
                                                                            
We rely on existing business clients for a significant portion of our
revenue. As we improve our Software Platform and Apps, we can attract
additional spend from these business clients. Our business clients include
indie studio developers and some of the largest mobile advertising platforms
in the world. We believe there is significant room for us to further expand
our relationships with these clients and increase their usage of our
Software Platform. We have invested in targeted sales and account-based
marketing efforts to identify and showcase opportunities to business clients
and plan to continue to do so in the future.

In the past, our business clients have generally increased their usage of
our Software Platform and Apps, and as a result, growth from existing
business clients has been a primary driver of our revenue growth. We must
continue to retain our existing business clients and expand their spend with
us over time to continue to grow our revenue, increase profitability and
drive greater cash flow.
                                                                            
   Add new business clients globally                                        
                                                                            
Our future success depends in part on our ability to acquire new business
clients. We recently increased our focus on markets outside the United
States to serve the needs of business clients globally. During the three
months ended September 30, 2021, only 43% of our revenue from business
clients was generated from outside of the United States. We believe that the
global opportunity is significant and will continue to expand as developers
and advertisers outside the United States adopt our Software Platform and
advertise on our Apps. We also see opportunities to acquire new business
clients outside of mobile gaming, as the capabilities of our Core
Technologies and Software Platform are relevant to the broader mobile app
ecosystem. We are investing in direct sales, product development, education,
and other capabilities to drive increased awareness and adoption of our
Software Platform and Apps, which investments may impact our profitability
in the near term as we seek further scale. We must continue to acquire new
business clients to grow our revenue, increase profitability, and drive
greater cash flow.
Optimization, growth, and expansion of our AppLovin Apps
We plan to continue to invest in developing new Apps and enhancing existing
Apps. Because our Apps are typically free to download and use, economically
acquiring users and monetizing through advertising and IAPs is critical to
the future success of our Apps. We plan to launch several new Apps per year,
as well as continue to make investments by acquiring and partnering with
studios in mobile gaming and other mobile app sectors.

Given our expertise in app marketing, we are able to pursue a highly-
optimized and scaled user acquisition investment playbook. During the three
months ended September 30, 2021, we invested $285.2 million in sales and
marketing, a large percentage of which was invested in user acquisition to
grow the number of users engaging with our Apps. We believe the scale,
insights, and effective monetization strategies provided through our
Software Platform and integrated business model allow us to optimize ad
spend across our portfolio of Apps. We also invest in the growth of our Apps
by improving in-game monetization, optimizing game economies and in-game
conversion, and opt-in business services, such as creative services and
localization. We must continue to optimize, grow, and expand our Apps
portfolio to grow our revenue, increase profitability, and drive greater
cash flow.
Continued execution of strategic acquisitions and partnerships
We intend to continue to make strategic acquisitions and enter into
strategic partnerships to grow our portfolio of Apps and add complementary
software and tools to our Core Technologies. From the beginning of 2018
through September 30, 2021, we have invested over $2.5 billion in 26
strategic acquisitions and partnerships with mobile app developers and for
technologies to enhance our Software Platform including the acquisition of
MAX in 2018, Adjust in April 2021 and the pending acquisition of MoPub. We
have been very successful in growing mobile apps that we have added to our
Apps portfolio.

While we have a strong pipeline of strategic acquisition and partnership
opportunities, we believe our future results of operations will be affected
by our ability to continue to identify and execute such transactions that
are accretive to our growth and profitability.
                                                                            
  Growth and structure of the mobile app ecosystem                          
                                                                            
Our business and results of operations will be impacted by industry factors
that drive overall performance of the mobile app ecosystem. The mobile app
ecosystem has grown rapidly in recent years. We expect that any
acceleration, or slowing, of this growth would affect our business and
results of operations. In addition, even if the mobile app ecosystem
continues to grow at its current rate, our ability to position ourselves
within the market will impact our business and results of operations.
                                     35                                     
Table of contents
Mobile app developers, including AppLovin, rely on third-party platforms,
such as the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, among others, to
distribute games, collect payments made for IAPs, and target users with
relevant advertising. We expect this to continue for the foreseeable future.
These third-party platforms have significant market power and discretion to
set platform fees, select which apps to promote, and decide how much
consumer information to provide to advertising networks that enable our
Software Platform to target users with personalized and relevant advertising
and allocate marketing campaigns in an efficient and cost-effective manner.
Any changes made in the policies of third-party platforms could drive rapid
change across the mobile app ecosystem. For example, in June 2020, Apple
announced a plan to overhaul IDFA as part of a new proposed application
tracking transparency framework that, among other things, would require opt-
in consent for certain types of tracking. This transparency framework, which
began being rolled out in late April 2021, has had a limited aggregate
impact and may in the future have an impact on the effectiveness of our
advertising practices and/or our ability to efficiently generate revenue for
our Apps.We rely in part on IDFA to provide us with data that helps our
Software Platform better market and monetize Apps. The proposed IDFA and
transparency changes may require us to further engage in significant changes
to our data collection practices, which may require our expenditure of
substantial costs and resources, and to the extent we are unable to utilize
IDFA or a similar offering, or if the transparency changes and any related
opt-in or other requirements result in decreases in the availability or
utility of data relating to Apps, our Software Platform may not be as
effective, we may not be able to continue to efficiently generate revenue
for our Apps, and our revenue and results of operations may be harmed.
Additionally, Apple implemented new requirements for consumer disclosures
regarding privacy and data processing practices in December 2020, which has
resulted in increased compliance requirements and could result in decreased
usage of our Apps. These or any similar changes to the policies of Apple or
Google may materially and adversely affect our business, financial
condition, and results of operations.To date, these data privacy changes
have had a relatively muted impact on our overall operations.

New tools for developers, industry standards, and platforms may emerge in
the future. We believe our focus on the mobile app ecosystem has allowed us
to understand the needs of our business clients and our relentless
innovation has enabled us to quickly adapt to changes in the industry and
pioneer new solutions. We must continue to innovate and stay ahead of
developments in the mobile app ecosystem in order for our business to
succeed and our results of operations to continue to improve.
                                                                            
  Impact of COVID-19                                                        
                                                                            
The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting social distancing and shelter-in-place
orders put in place around the world have caused widespread disruption in
global economies, productivity, and financial markets and have altered the
way in which we conduct our day-to-day business. As a result of the
COVID-19, pandemic we have temporarily closed our offices around the world,
including our corporate headquarters in Palo Alto, California, and
implemented travel restrictions. Our Software Platform and Apps do not
require physical interaction, thus, our ability to meet the needs of our
clients and users has not been materially affected. The full impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and the extent to which the pandemic
may impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations in
the future remains uncertain. See the section titled “Risk Factors—The
COVID-19 pandemic and responses thereto across the globe have altered how
individuals interact with each other and affected how we and our business
partners are operating, and the extent to which this situation will impact
our future results of operations remains uncertain” for additional
information.

On October 6, 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire from
Twitter, Inc. the MoPub business for approximately $1.05 billion. The
closing of the transaction is subject to customary conditions and regulatory
approvals. We plan to integrate MoPub’s reach and product features into our
existing Software Platform to better maximize revenue growth and improve
efficiencies for our combined customers.

We collect Business Revenue from advertisers spending on our Software
Platform and Apps. Business Revenue from our Software Platform is generated
from our advertisers, typically on a performance-based, cost-per-install
basis, then shared with our advertising publishers, typically on a cost per
impression model. Business Revenue generated from our Apps comes from
advertisers that purchase ad inventory from our diverse portfolio of Apps.
Business Revenue from our Apps was 45% of total Business Revenue for the
three months ended September 30, 2021.

  Cost of Revenue and Operating Expenses                                    
                                                                            
Cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of third-party payment
processing fees for distribution partners, amortization of acquired
technology related intangible assets, and expenses associated with operating
our network infrastructure. Third-party payment processing fees relate to
Consumer Revenue. The fees for IAPs are processed and collected by third-
party distribution partners. Network operating costs include bandwidth,
energy, other equipment costs related to our co-located data centers and
costs for third-party cloud service providers. We expect our cost of revenue
to increase in absolute dollars over the long term as our business and
revenue continue to grow. We also expect our cost of revenue as a percentage
of revenue to fluctuate period-over-period.

Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of user
acquisition costs, other advertising expenses, personnel-related expenses
for salaries, employee benefits, and stock-based compensation for employees
engaged in sales and marketing, and amortization of acquired user-related
intangible assets, marketing programs, travel, customer service costs, and
allocated facilities and information technology costs.

We plan to continue to invest in sales and marketing to grow our customer
base and increase brand awareness. As a result, we expect sales and
marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars. We also expect our sales
and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue to fluctuate period-over-
period in the near term as we invest to grow our customer base and increase
brand awareness, and to decrease over the long term as we benefit from
greater scale.

Research and development. Research and development expenses consist
primarily of product development costs, including personnel-related expenses
for salaries, employee benefits, and stock-based compensation for employees
engaged in research and development, professional services costs related to
development of new apps by third parties, consulting costs, regulatory
compliance costs, and allocated facilities and information technology costs.

We plan to continue to invest in research and development to continue to
enhance our Core Technologies and Software Platform, and to improve existing
games and develop new games. As a result, we expect research and development
expenses to increase in absolute dollars. We also expect our research and
development expenses as a percentage of revenue to fluctuate period-over-
period in the near term as we invest to enhance our Core Technologies and
Software Platform and improve our existing Apps and develop new Apps, and to
decrease over the long term as we benefit from greater scale.

General and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist
primarily of costs incurred to support our business, including personnel-
related expenses for salaries, employee benefits, and stock-based
compensation for employees engaged in finance, accounting, legal, human
resources and administration, professional services fees for legal,
accounting, recruiting, and administrative services (including acquisition-
related expenses), insurance, travel, and allocated facilities and
information technology costs.

We plan to continue to invest in our general and administrative function to
support the growth of our business. In addition, we expect to incur
additional general and administrative expenses as a result of operating as a
public company, including expenses related to compliance and reporting
obligations of a public company, increased insurance and investor relations
expenses, and increased professional services fees (including acquisition-
related expenses). As a result, we expect general and administrative
expenses to increase in absolute dollars. We also expect our general and
administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue to fluctuate period-over-
period in the near term as we invest to support the growth of our business,
and to decrease over the long term as we benefit from greater scale.
                                                                            
  Other Income and Expenses                                                 
                                                                            
Interest expense and loss on settlement of debt. Interest expense and loss
on settlement of debt consists primarily of loss related to debt
extinguishment, interest expense associated with our outstanding debt,
including accretion of debt discount, and changes in fair value of interest
rate swap accounted for as a cash flow hedge related to the stream of
variable interest payments associated with a portion of our outstanding
debt.

Other income (expense), net. Other income (expense), net, includes interest
earned on our cash and cash equivalents, gains and losses related to
embedded derivatives and other financial instruments accounted for at fair
value, and foreign currency exchange gains (losses), which consist primarily
of remeasurement of transactions and monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in currencies other than the functional currency at the end of
the period.

Provision for (benefit from) income taxes. We are subject to income taxes in
the United States and foreign jurisdictions in which we do business. These
foreign jurisdictions have different statutory tax rates than those in the
United States. Additionally, certain of our foreign earnings may also be
taxable in the United States. Accordingly, our
                                     37

effective tax rate will vary depending on the relative proportion of foreign
to domestic income, impacts from acquisition restructuring, deduction
benefits related to foreign-derived intangible income, future changes in the
valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax
laws. Additionally, our effective tax rate can vary based on the amount of
pre-tax income or loss.

In 2020, we reached an agreement to amend the terms of an asset acquisition
agreement to settle the acquisition holdback and a portion of the earn-out
due to the seller 12 months following the acquisition’s closing in 2019. We
recorded an extinguishment loss of $74.7 million in 2020 in connection with
this subsequent agreement and recognized a loss equal to the excess of the
fair value of consideration paid to the seller and the fair value of the
contingent consideration determined immediately prior to this amendment. We
agreed to settle for a combination of a cash payment and issuance of certain
shares of our Class A common stock.
Lease modification and abandonment of leasehold improvements
We recognized a net loss of $7.9 million in 2020 in connection with the
termination of one of Machine Zone’s leases and the write-off of leasehold
improvements and other assets related to this real estate lease.

In the three months ended September 30, 2021, interest expense and loss on

In the nine months ended September 30, 2021, interest expense and loss on
settlement of debt increased by $15.2 million, or 26% compared to the same

In the nine months ended September 30, 2021, other income (expense), net
decreased by $6.3 million, or 119% compared to the same period in the prior
year. The decrease was primarily due to a net write-off of investments in
securities of $4.8 million, $3.5 million in fair value remeasurement of
convertible securities, and $3.4 million in debt issuance costs, partially
offset by $3.2 million in fair value remeasurement of embedded derivatives
and $3.0 in net foreign exchange gains.

In the three months ended September 30, 2021, provision for (benefit from)
income taxes increased by $21.4 million compared to the same period in the
prior year. The increase was primarily due to an increase in net income
before taxes of $111.5 million during the three months ended September 30,
2021, as compared to a net loss before taxes during the three months ended
September 30, 2020, an increase in the foreign tax rate differential of
$16.0 million, establishment of valuation allowance against losses which
cannot be realized of $5.5 million , offset by an increase in foreign
derived intangible income deduction of $8.0 million , an increase in net
excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $3.0 million, and a
decrease in extinguishments of acquisition-related contingent consideration
of $7.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2021.

In the nine months ended September 30, 2021, provision for (benefit from)
income taxes increased by $16.1 million compared to the same period in the
prior year. The increase was primarily due to an increase in net income
before taxes of $127.0 million during the nine months ended September 30,
2021, as compared to a net loss before taxes in the nine months ended
September 30, 2020, ,establishment of valuation allowance against losses

benefits from stock-based compensation of $7.5 million, and a decrease in
extinguishments of acquisition-related contingent consideration of $8.9
million during the nine months ended September 30, 2021.

Since inception, we financed our operations primarily through payments
received from business clients using our Software Platform and advertising
on our Apps, and from user IAPs from our Apps, and through net proceeds we
received from the sales of our convertible preferred stock and borrowings
made under our Credit Agreement. On April 19, 2021, we completed our IPO, in
which we sold 22,500,000 shares of Class A common stock at price to the
public of $80.00 per share. We received aggregate net proceeds of $1.75
billion after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $47.2
million and offering expenses of $7.9 million subject to certain cost
reimbursements. As of September 30, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents
of $1.05 billion.

We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents would be sufficient
to satisfy our anticipated working capital and capital expenditures needs
for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements, however,
will depend on many factors, including our growth rate; expansion of sales
and marketing activities; timing and extent of spending to support our
research and development efforts; capital expenditures to purchase hardware
and software; and our continued need to invest in our IT infrastructure to
support our growth. In addition, we may enter into additional strategic
partnerships as well as agreements to acquire or invest in teams and
technologies, including intellectual property rights, which could increase
our cash requirements. As a result of these and other factors, we may be
required to seek additional equity or debt financing sooner than we
currently anticipate. If additional financing from outside sources is
required, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us, or at
all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when required, or if we
cannot expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business
opportunities because we lack sufficient capital, our business, financial
condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.

proceeds from our IPO to repay in full the aggregate amount of $400.0
million outstanding under the revolving credit facility in April 2021. As of
September 30, 2021, our total outstanding indebtedness under the Credit
Agreement was $1.78 billion, consisting of outstanding term loans. See Note
8, Credit Agreement, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial
statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for
additional information.

In October 2021, we amended the credit agreement whereby certain additional
lenders agreed to provide incremental loans in an aggregate amount of $1.5
billion.

  Contractual Obligations                                                   
                                                                            
In April 2021, we completed two separate transactions to acquire certain
mobile game Apps from two foreign-based independent mobile game developers
in exchange for an aggregate upfront cash consideration of $300.0 million
and potential future earn-out payments. With respect to the first
transaction, the potential future earn-out payments are contingent on the
revenue generated by the acquired mobile game Apps exceeding a certain
revenue threshold, which will be measured and payable (if applicable) each
year for four years from the date of the transaction. With respect to the
second transaction, the potential future earn-out payments will be
determined in a manner similar to the first transaction, in addition to a
potential one-time earn-out payment of $50.0 million contingent on the
achievement of a certain monthly revenue milestone within the four years
following the date of the transaction. Because these contingent
consideration arrangements are based on the success of relevant Apps and are
not guaranteed, we do not expect our results of operations would be
materially and adversely affected by the payment of amounts under such
arrangements.

In May 2021, we amended a certain agreement with a cloud service provider to
increase the aggregate spend commitment from $130.0 million to $300.0
million through May 2026.

In June 2021, we acquired certain mobile game Apps from a foreign-based
independent mobile game developer in exchange for an upfront cash
consideration of $130.0 million and future earn-out payments. The potential
future earn-out payments for the acquired mobile Apps are contingent on the
revenue and/or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization ("EBITDA") generated by the acquired Apps exceeding certain
thresholds. Because these contingent consideration arrangements are based on
the success of relevant Apps and are not guaranteed, we do not expect our
results of operations would be materially and adversely affected by the
payment of amounts under such arrangements.

With the exception of the transactions described above and except for
scheduled payments from the ongoing business, there were no material changes
in our commitments under contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 as
disclosed in our final prospectus related to our IPO dated April 14, 2021
(the "Prospectus") and filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act").
                                                                            
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements                                            
                                                                            
As of September 30, 2021, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements
that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our
financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenue, or
expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital
resources that are material to investors.
                                                                            
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates                                
                                                                            
Our condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance
with GAAP. The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial
statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as
the reported revenue generated and expenses incurred during the reporting
periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various
other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the
results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying
value of assets and liabilities and the amount of revenue and expenses that
are not readily apparent from other sources. On an ongoing basis, we
evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from
these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and
estimates during the three months ended September 30, 2021, as compared to
those disclosed in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations set forth in the Prospectus.

We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business, which
primarily relate to fluctuations in interest rates.

As of September 30, 2021, we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of
$1.05 billion. A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates would not have a
material impact on our financial condition or results of operations due to
the short-term nature of our cash equivalents.

As of September 30, 2021, we had a debt balance of $1.78 billion. A
hypothetical 50 basis point change in interest rates as of September 30,
2021 would not have a material impact on our net income for the three months
ended September 30, 2021.

   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures                         
                                                                            
Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the
Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer have concluded that, as of such date, our
disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance
level.
                                                                            
  Changes in Internal Control                                               
                                                                            
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
identified in management’s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or
15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the period covered by this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
                                                                            
   Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures                  
                                                                            
Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures
or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and
all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can
provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect
the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls
must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent
limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide
absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any,
have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that
judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur
because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be
circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or
more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any
system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the
likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design
will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may
deteriorate. Due to inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system,
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims that
arise in the ordinary course of business, as well as governmental and other
regulatory investigations and proceedings. In addition, third parties may
from time to time assert claims against us in the form of letters and other
communications. We are not currently a party to any legal proceedings that,
if determined adversely to us, would, in our opinion, have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations,

our business partners and to determine the scope, enforceability, and
validity of third-party proprietary rights, or to establish our proprietary
rights. The results of any current or future litigation cannot be predicted
with certainty, and regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an
adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of

You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below,
together with all of the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q, including our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
and the related notes and the section titled “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Our business,
financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could also be
adversely affected by risks and uncertainties that are not presently known
to us or that we currently believe are not material. If any of the risks
actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations,
and prospects could be adversely affected. In that event, the market price
of our Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of
your investment.
                                                                            
  Risk Factor Summary                                                       
                                                                            
Investing in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk because
our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, as fully
described below. The principal factors and uncertainties that make investing
in our Class A common stock risky include, among other things:

• We have a limited operating history, especially with respect to our
AppLovin Apps, which makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and
future performance and the risks we may encounter.

• Our results of operations are likely to fluctuate from period-to-period,
which could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.

• The mobile app ecosystem is intensely competitive. If business clients or
users prefer our competitors’ products or services over our own, our
business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely
affected.

• The mobile app ecosystem is subject to rapid technological change, and if
we do not adapt to, and appropriately allocate our resources among, emerging
technologies and business models, our business, financial condition, and
results of operations could be adversely affected.

• The failure to attract new business clients, the loss of clients, or a
reduction in spending by these clients could adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.

• If we are unable to launch or acquire new Apps and successfully monetize
them, or continue to improve the experience and monetization of our existing
Apps, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be
adversely affected.

• If we fail to retain existing users or add new users cost-effectively, or
if our users decrease their level of engagement with Apps, our business,
financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.

• We have experienced significant growth through strategic acquisitions and
partnerships, and we face risks related to the integration of such
acquisitions and the management of such growth.

• We plan to continue to expand and diversify our operations through
strategic acquisitions and partnerships. We face a number of risks related
to these transactions.

• We rely on third-party platforms to distribute our Apps and collect
revenue, and if our ability to do so is harmed, or such third-party
platforms change their policies in such a way that restricts our business,
increases our expenses, or limits the information we derive from our Apps,
our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be
adversely affected.

• The multi-class structure of our common stock and the Voting Agreement
among the Class B Stockholders have the effect of concentrating voting power
with the Class B Stockholders, which will limit your ability to influence
the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including
the election of our board of directors, the adoption of amendments to our
certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and the approval of any merger,
consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other
major corporate transaction.

• We are considered a “controlled company” within the meaning of the Nasdaq
corporate governance requirements, and, as a result, we qualify for, and
intend to rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance
requirements.
                                                                            
   Risks Related to Our Business and Industry                               
                                                                            
We have a limited operating history, especially with respect to our AppLovin
Apps, which makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future
performance and the risks we may encounter.
Our limited operating history, especially with respect to our AppLovin Apps,
which we launched in 2018, may make it difficult to evaluate our current
business and our future performance. We have encountered and will continue
to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing
companies in rapidly changing industries, such as the mobile app ecosystem,
including our ability to:

• accurately forecast our revenue and plan our operating expenses;

• attract new and retain existing business clients using our AppLovin
Software Platform and users of our Apps;

• successfully compete with current and future competitors, some of whom are
also our clients;

• successfully expand our business in existing markets and enter new markets
and geographies;

• successfully execute strategic acquisitions and partnerships;

• develop a scalable, high-performance technology infrastructure that can
efficiently and reliably handle increased usage, as well as the deployment
of new features and services;

• comply with existing and new laws and regulations applicable to our
business;

• anticipate and respond to macroeconomic changes and changes in the markets
in which we operate;

• establish and maintain our brand and reputation;

• adapt to rapidly evolving trends in the ways businesses and consumers
interact with technology;

• effectively manage our rapid growth;

• avoid interruptions or disruptions in our AppLovin Core Technologies,
Software Platform, or Apps; and

• hire, integrate, and retain key personnel.

Further, because we have limited historical financial data, including
limited data regarding the integration of our strategic acquisitions and
partnerships, and operate in a rapidly evolving market, any financial
planning and forecasting, including predictions about our future revenue and
expenses, may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer
operating history or operated in a more predictable market. If our
assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan
and operate our business, are incorrect or change, or if we do not address
these risks successfully, our results of operations could differ materially
from our expectations. If we fail to address the risks and uncertainties
that we face, including those described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors”
section, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could
be adversely affected.

Our results of operations are likely to fluctuate from period-to-period,
which could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.

Our results of operations have fluctuated in the past and are likely to
fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year in the
future for a variety of reasons, many of which are outside of our control
and difficult to predict. As a result, you should not rely upon our
historical results of operations as indicators of future performance.
Numerous factors can influence our results of operations, including:

• our ability to maintain and grow our business client and user bases;

Table of contents
• changes to our Core Technologies, Software Platform, Apps, or other
offerings, or the development and introduction of new software or
development of new mobile apps by our studios or our competitors;

• changes to the policies or practices of companies or governmental agencies
that determine access to third-party platforms, such as the Apple App Store
and the Google Play Store, or to our Software Platform, Apps, website, or
the internet generally;

• changes to the policies or practices of third-party platforms, such as the
Apple App Store and the Google Play Store, including with respect to Apple’s
Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA), which helps advertisers assess the
effectiveness of their advertising efforts, and with respect to transparency
regarding data processing;

• the diversification and growth of revenue sources beyond our current
Software Platform and Apps;

• the actions of our competitors, both with respect to their own offerings
and, to the extent such competitors are also our clients, with respect to
their use of our Software Platform;

• costs and expenses related to the strategic acquisitions and partnerships,
including costs related to integrating mobile gaming studios or other
companies that we acquire, as well as costs and expenses related to the
development of our Core Technologies, Software Platform, or Apps;

• our ability to achieve or maintain profitability;

• increases in and timing of operating expenses that we may incur to grow
and expand our operations and to remain competitive;

• system failures or outages, or actual or perceived breaches of security or
privacy, and the costs associated with preventing, responding to, or
remediating any such outages or breaches;

• changes in the legislative or regulatory environment, including with
respect to privacy and data protection, or actions by governments or
regulators, including fines, orders, or consent decrees;

• charges associated with impairment of any assets on our balance sheet or
changes in our expected estimated useful life of property and equipment and
intangible assets;

• adverse litigation judgments, settlements, or other litigation-related
costs and the fees associated with investigating and defending claims;

• changes in the legislative or regulatory environment, such as with respect
to privacy and data protection;

• the overall tax rate for our business, which may be affected by the mix of
income we earn in the United States and in jurisdictions with comparatively
lower tax rates;

• the impact of changes in tax laws or judicial or regulatory
interpretations of tax laws, which are recorded in the period such laws are
enacted or interpretations are issued and may significantly affect the
effective tax rate of that period;

• the application of new or changing financial accounting standards or
practices; and

• changes in regional or global business or macroeconomic conditions,
including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may impact the other
factors described above.

In particular, it is difficult to predict if, when, or how quickly newly-
launched software may begin to generate revenue or decline in popularity.
Further, we cannot be certain if a new App will become popular amongst users
and generate revenue. The success of our business depends in part on our
ability to develop and enhance our Software Platform and consistently and
timely launch new Apps. It is difficult for us to predict with certainty
when we will expand our Software Platform suite or launch a new App as we
may require longer development schedules or soft launch periods to meet our
quality standards and expectations. If our business clients do not adopt our
new Software Platform offerings, or develop or further invest in their own
competing alternatives, or if we are unable to successfully launch or
acquire new Apps or maintain or improve existing Apps, our business and
results of operations could be adversely affected. Fluctuations in our
results of operations may cause such results to fall below our financial
guidance or the expectations of analysts or investors, which could cause the
market price of our Class A common stock to decline.

The mobile app ecosystem is intensely competitive. If business clients or
users prefer our competitors’ products or services over our own, our
business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely
affected.

We face significant competition in the mobile app ecosystem. We offer a
suite of solutions for developers to get their mobile apps discovered and
downloaded by the right users, optimize return on marketing spend, and
maximize the monetization of their engagement. We collect revenue from
business clients for fees paid by mobile app advertisers, including
developers, that use our Software Platform and from the sale of advertising
inventory of our Apps. Advertisers often engage with several advertising
platforms and networks to purchase advertisements on mobile apps and
developers often engage with multiple tools to market and monetize their
apps. Accordingly, we face significant competition from traditional, online
and mobile businesses that provide ad networks and platforms, mobile apps
and games, media, and other services for advertisers to reach relevant
audiences. We also face competition from providers of developer tools that
enable developers to reach their audiences or manage or optimize their
advertising campaigns. These companies vary in size and include Facebook,
Google, Twitter, and Unity Software as well as various private companies.
Several of these companies, including Facebook, Google, and Unity Software,
are also our partners and Enterprise Clients. Additionally, our studios
build many of our Apps using the development kits offered by Unity Software.
Clients who are also competitors may decide to invest in their own offerings
rather than continue to use our Software Platform or advertise on our Apps.

Additionally, we also compete with businesses that develop online and mobile
games and other mobile apps, which vary in size and include companies such
as Activision Blizzard, Tencent, and Zynga, as well as other public and
private companies. Many of these companies are also our partners and
clients. As we expand our global operations and mobile app offerings, we
increasingly face competition from high-profile companies with significant
online presences that may introduce new or expanded offerings, such as
Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Snap. In addition, other large
companies that to date have not actively focused on mobile apps or gaming
may decide to develop mobile apps or gaming offerings, such as Amazon’s
recently introduced games platform, or partner with other developers. Some
of these current and potential competitors have significantly greater
resources that can be used to develop, acquire, or brand additional mobile
apps or gaming alternatives, and may have more diversified revenue sources
than we do and therefore may be less severely affected by changes in
consumer preferences, regulations, or other developments that may impact our
business or industry.

Further, as there are relatively low barriers to entry to develop and
publish a mobile app, we expect new competitors to enter the market and
existing competitors to allocate more resources towards developing and
marketing competing games and apps. Because our mobile games are free-to-
play, our Apps compete primarily on the basis of user experience rather than
price. The proliferation of apps makes it difficult for us to differentiate
ourselves from our competitors and compete for users and the success of our
Apps will depend in part on our Software Platform continuing to provide
effective marketing and monetization tools.

We also face competition for advertising spending and for the discretionary
spending, leisure time, and attention of our users from game platforms such
as personal computer and console games, and other leisure time activities,
such as television, movies, music, sports, and the internet. In addition,
non-game applications for mobile devices, such as social media and
messaging, television, movies, music, dating, and sports, have become
increasingly popular, making the overall mobile app ecosystem highly
fragmented and making it more difficult for any mobile app to differentiate
itself. To the extent we explore new business opportunities in the mobile
app ecosystem or otherwise, we may also compete with established businesses
with more experience in such areas. Our future growth depends in part on the
overall health of the mobile app ecosystem and in particular, mobile gaming.
Increasing competition could result in decreases in our App users, increased
user acquisition costs, lower engagement with our Apps, and loss of key
personnel, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial
condition, or results of operations.

Some of our current and potential competitors may be domiciled in different
countries and subject to political, legal, and regulatory regimes that
enable them to compete more effectively than us, particularly outside of the
United States. Some of our current and potential competitors may have
greater resources, more diversified revenue streams, better technological or
data analytics capabilities, or stronger brands or competitive positions in
certain product segments, geographic regions, or user demographics than we
do. If business clients or users prefer our competitors’ products or
services over our own, or if our competitors are better able to adapt to
changes in the preferences of advertisers or users, regulations, or other
developments, our business, financial condition, and results of operations
could be adversely affected.

The mobile app ecosystem is subject to rapid technological change, and if we
do not adapt to, and appropriately allocate our resources among, emerging
technologies and business models, our business, financial condition, and
results of operations could be adversely affected.

Technology changes rapidly in the mobile app ecosystem. Our future success
depends in part on our ability to adapt to trends and to innovate. To
attract new business clients and users and increase revenue from our current
business clients and users, we will need to enhance and improve our Core
Technologies, Software Platform, and Apps. Enhancements of our existing
technology and offerings, and new offerings, may not be introduced in a
timely or cost-effective manner and may contain errors or defects.

Our business also currently depends in part on the growth and evolution of
the internet, especially mobile internet-enabled devices. The number of
people using mobile internet-enabled devices has increased rapidly over
time, and we expect that this trend will continue. However, the mobile app
ecosystem may not grow in the way we anticipate. We must continually
anticipate and adapt to emerging technologies to stay competitive. As the
technological infrastructure for internet access improves and evolves,
consumers will be presented with more opportunities to access apps and play
games on a variety of devices and platforms and to experience other leisure
activities that may compete with mobile apps. Forecasting the financial
impact of these emerging technologies and business models is inherently
uncertain and volatile. If we decide to support a new technology or business
model in the future, it may require partnering with a new platform,
technology, or business partner, which may be on terms that are less
favorable to us than those for traditional technologies or business models.

To invest in a new technology or expand our offerings, we must invest
financial resources and management attention. We may invest significant
resources in a new offering or in a strategic acquisition or partnership,
which could prove unsuccessful or prevent us from directing these resources
towards other opportunities. We may never recover the often-substantial up-
front costs of developing and marketing emerging technologies or business
models, or recover the opportunity cost of diverting management and
financial resources. Further, our competitors may adopt an emerging
technology or business model more quickly or effectively than we do,
creating products that are technologically superior to ours or attract more
users than ours.

If, on the other hand, we do not continue to enhance our Core Technologies,
Software Platform, or Apps, or do not appropriately allocate our resources
amongst opportunities, or we otherwise elect not to pursue new business
models that achieve significant commercial success, we may face adverse
consequences. For example, we do not currently offer our Apps on all devices
or all gaming platforms. If the devices on which our Apps are available
decline in popularity or become obsolete faster than anticipated, or if new
platforms emerge other than those on which our games are offered, we could
experience a decline in revenue and in our number of App users, and we may
not achieve the anticipated return on our development efforts. It may take
significant time and expenditures to shift product development resources to
new technologies, and it may be more difficult to compete against existing
products incorporating such technologies. If new technologies render mobile
devices obsolete or we are unable to successfully adapt to and appropriately
allocate our resources amongst current and new technologies, our business,
financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.

The failure to attract new business clients, the loss of clients, or a
reduction in spending by these clients could adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.

A significant portion of our revenue is Business Revenue. We collect
Business Revenue from advertisers spending on our Software Platform and
Apps. Business Revenue from our Software Platform, which is mostly from
AppDiscovery, is generated from our advertisers, typically on a performance-
based, cost-per-install basis, then shared with our advertising publishers,
typically on a cost per impression model. Business Revenue generated from
our Apps comes from advertisers that purchase ad inventory from our diverse
portfolio of mobile games. As is common in the mobile app ecosystem and in
the advertising industry, our business clients do not have long-term
advertising commitments with us. Our success depends in part on our ability
to satisfy our advertising partners.

Business Revenue could also be impacted by a number of other factors,
including:

• our ability to attract and retain business clients;

• our ability to improve the effectiveness and predictability of our
advertising and matching algorithms;

• our ability to maintain or increase advertiser demand and third-party
publisher supply, the quantity, or quality of advertisements shown to users,
or our pricing of advertisements;

• our ability to continue to increase user access to and engagement with our
Apps;
                                     51                                     
Table of contents
• mobile app changes or inventory management decisions we may make that
change the size, format, frequency, or relative prominence of advertisements
displayed on our Apps;

• our ability to recruit, train, and retain personnel to support continued
growth of our Software Platform;

• our ability to establish and maintain our brand and reputation;

• loss of market share to our competitors, including if competitors offer
lower priced, more integrated, or otherwise more effective products;

• the development and success of technologies designed to block the display
of advertisements or block our ad measurement tools, which have in the past
impacted and may in the future impact our business, or technologies that
make it easier for users to opt out of behavioral targeting;

• the availability, accuracy, utility, and security of analytics and
measurement solutions offered by us or third parties that demonstrate the
value of our Software Platform to advertisers, developers and publishers, or
our ability to further improve such tools;

• government actions or legislative, regulatory, or other legal developments
relating to advertising, including developments that may impact our ability
to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of advertising;

• changes that limit our ability to deliver, target, or measure the
effectiveness of advertising, including changes to policies by mobile
operating system and third-party platform providers, and the degree to which
users opt out of certain types of ad targeting as a result of changes and
controls implemented in connection with such policy changes and with the
E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (the GDPR), ePrivacy Directive, the
California Consumer Privacy Act (the CCPA), and the Children’s Online
Privacy Protection Act (the COPPA);

• decisions by business clients to reduce their advertising due to concerns
about legal liability or uncertainty regarding their own legal and
compliance obligations, or due to negative publicity, regardless of its
accuracy, involving us, our user data practices, advertising metrics or
tools, our Software Platform or Apps, or other companies in our industry;
and

• the impact of macroeconomic conditions, including the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic and responses thereto, and seasonality, whether in the
advertising industry in general, or among specific types of advertisers or
within particular geographies.

From time to time, certain of these factors have adversely affected our
revenue to varying degrees. The occurrence of any of these or other factors
in the future could result in a reduction in demand for our Software
Platform and use of our Apps, which may reduce the prices we receive for our
advertisements or cause business clients to stop advertising with us
altogether, either of which would adversely affect our business and results
of operations. The failure to attract new business clients, loss of business
clients, or reduction in spending by business clients could adversely affect
our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
If we are unable to launch or acquire new Apps and successfully monetize
them, or continue to improve the experience and monetization of our existing
Apps, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be
adversely affected.
Our business depends in part on launching or acquiring, and continuing to
service, mobile apps that users will download and spend time and money
using. We have devoted and we expect to continue to devote substantial
resources to the research, development, analytics, and marketing of our
Apps. Our development and marketing efforts are focused on improving the
experience of our existing Apps, developing new Apps, and successfully
monetizing our Apps. Our Apps generate revenue primarily through the sale of
advertising, a substantial portion of which comes from other mobile gaming
clients, and in-app purchases (IAPs). For Apps distributed through third-
party platforms, we are required to share a portion of the proceeds from in-
game sales with the platform providers, which share may be subject to
changes or increases over time. In order to achieve and maintain our
profitability, we need to generate sufficient revenue from our existing and
new Apps to offset our ongoing development, marketing, and other operating
expenses.

Successfully monetizing our Apps is difficult and requires that we deliver
user experiences that a sufficient number of users will pay for through IAPs
or we are able to otherwise sufficiently monetize our Apps, including by
serving in-app advertising. The success of our Apps depends in part on
unpredictable and volatile factors beyond our control including user
preferences, competing apps, new third-party platforms, and the availability
of other
                                     52                                     
Table of contents
entertainment experiences. If our Apps do not meet user expectations or if
they are not brought to market in a timely and effective manner, our
business and results of operations could be adversely affected.

In addition, our ability to successfully launch or acquire Apps and their
ability to achieve commercial success will depend in part on our ability to:

• effectively market our Apps to existing and new users;

• achieve a positive return on investment from our marketing and user
acquisition costs or achieve organic user growth;

• adapt to changing trends, user preferences, new technologies, and new
feature sets for mobile and other devices, including determining whether to
invest in development for any new technologies, and achieve a positive
return on the costs associated with such adaptation;

• continue to adapt mobile app feature sets for an increasingly diverse set
of mobile devices, including various operating systems and specifications,
limited bandwidth, and varying processing power and screen sizes;

• achieve and maintain successful user engagement and effectively monetize
our Apps;

• develop mobile games that can build upon or become franchise games and
expand and enhance our mobile games after their initial releases;

• develop Apps other than mobile games;

• identify and execute strategic acquisitions and partnerships;

• attract advertisers to advertise on our Apps;

• partner with third-party platforms and obtain featuring opportunities;

• compete successfully against a large and growing number of competitors;

• accurately forecast the timing and expense of our operations, including
mobile app and feature development, marketing, and user acquisition;

• minimize and quickly resolve bugs or outages;

• acquire, or invest in, and successfully integrate high quality mobile app
companies or technologies; and

• retain and motivate talented and experienced developers and other key
personnel from such acquisitions and investments.

These and other uncertainties make it difficult to know whether we will
succeed in continuing to develop and launch new Apps. Even if successful,
certain genres of mobile apps, such as casual games, may have a relatively
short lifespan. Further, as our Apps expand into additional genres of mobile
games or additional categories of mobile apps, we will face risks as well as
market, legal and regulatory challenges specific to those genres or
categories. For example, in mid-core games, there is typically a higher
upfront investment prior to the launch of a game compared to casual games,
which means publishing a new game in that genre will expose us to greater
risks as our financial condition and results of operations will be more
significantly adversely affected to the extent such a game does not become
popular and commercially successful. If we are not successful in launching
new mobile games or expanding into other genres of mobile games or
categories of mobile apps, our business, financial condition, and results of
operations could be adversely affected.
If we fail to retain existing users or add new users cost-effectively, or if
our users decrease their level of engagement with Apps, our business,
financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.
The size of our user base and the level of user engagement with our Apps are
critical to our success. Our results of operations have been and will
continue to be significantly determined by our success in acquiring and
engaging App users. We expect that the number of our App users may fluctuate
or decline in one or more markets from time to time, particularly in markets
where we have achieved higher penetration rates. In addition, if people do
not perceive our Apps as useful or entertaining, we may not be able to
attract or retain users or otherwise maintain or increase the frequency and
duration of their engagement, which could harm our revenue. A number of
mobile apps that achieved early popularity have since seen their user bases
or user engagement levels decline. There is no guarantee that we will not
experience a similar erosion of our App users or user engagement levels. Our
user engagement patterns have changed over time, and user engagement can be
difficult to measure, particularly as we
                                     53                                     
Table of contents
introduce new and different Apps. Any number of factors can adversely affect
user growth and engagement, including if:

• users increasingly engage with mobile apps offered by competitors or
mobile apps in categories other than those of our Apps;

• we fail to introduce new Apps or features that users find engaging or that
achieve a high level of market acceptance or we introduce new Apps, or make
changes to existing Apps that are not favorably received;

• users feel that their experience is diminished as a result of the
decisions we make with respect to the frequency, prominence, format, size,
and quality of advertisements that we display;

• users have difficulty installing, updating, or otherwise accessing our
Apps as a result of actions by us or third parties;

• we are unable to continue to develop Apps that work with a variety of
mobile operating systems and networks; and

• questions about the quality of our Apps, our data practices or concerns
related to privacy and sharing of personal information and other user data,
safety, security, or other factors.

Additionally, we expect it will become increasingly difficult and more
expensive for us to acquire users for our Apps for a variety of reasons,
including the increasingly competitive nature of the mobile app ecosystem
and the significant amount of time and attention users are dedicating to
competing entertainment options. Further, we believe that changes that Apple
has implemented during the last several years to its platform, particularly
the removal of the Top Grossing rankings and decreasing the prominence of
the Top Free rankings, may adversely affect the number of organic downloads
of our Apps. If our competitors increase their user acquisition spending, we
could experience higher costs per an install for our Apps, which would
adversely affect our revenue and margins. Furthermore, our spending on user
acquisition is based on certain assumptions about their projected behavior,
particularly for new Apps for which we do not have similar Apps in our
portfolio to aid us in our modeling efforts. If we are unable to grow our
user base and increase our user engagement levels, or unable to do so cost
effectively, our business, financial condition, and results of operations
could be adversely affected.

We have experienced significant growth through strategic acquisitions and
partnerships, and we face risks related to the integration of such
acquisitions and the management of such growth.

As part of our growth strategy, we have frequently acquired companies,
businesses, personnel, and technologies in the past, and we intend to
continue to evaluate and pursue strategic acquisitions and partnerships. For
example, since 2018, we have invested over $2.5 billion across more than 26
strategic acquisitions and partnerships, including for the acquisition of
PeopleFun, Inc. in the first quarter of 2018, MAX Advertising Systems, Inc.
in the third quarter of 2018, SafeDK Mobile Ltd. in July 2019, Machine Zone,
Inc. (Machine Zone) in May 2020, and adjust GmbH (Adjust) in April 2021. In
addition, in October 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire
from Twitter, Inc. the MoPub business for approximately $1.05 billion. Each
of these acquisitions requires unique approaches to integration due to,
among other reasons, the structure of the acquisitions, the size, locations,
and cultural differences among their teams and ours, and has required, and
will continue to require, attention from our management team. As we continue
to grow, the size of our acquisitions and investments may increase. For
instance, our acquisitions of Machine Zone and Adjust were our largest
acquisitions to date. In addition to the larger purchase prices associated
with such acquisitions and investments, larger acquisitions and investments
may also require additional management resources to integrate more
significant and often more complex businesses into our company. We will
continue to explore and evaluate additional acquisitions, some of which may
be the same size or even larger in scale and investment than the Machine
Zone and Adjust acquisitions.

Our future success depends in part on our ability to integrate these
acquisitions and manage these businesses, partnerships, and transactions
effectively. If we are unable to obtain the anticipated benefits or
synergies of such acquisitions, or we encounter difficulties integrating
acquired businesses with ours, our business, financial condition, and
results of operations could be adversely affected.

Challenges and risks from such strategic acquisitions and partnerships
include:

• diversion of our management’s attention in the acquisition and integration
process, including oversight over acquired businesses which continue their
operations under contingent consideration provisions in acquisition
agreements;
                                     54                                     
Table of contents
• declining employee morale and retention issues resulting from changes in
compensation, or changes in management, reporting relationships, or future
performance;

• the need to integrate the operations, systems, technologies, products, and
personnel of each acquired company, the inefficiencies and lack of control
that may result if such integration is delayed or not implemented, and
unforeseen difficulties and expenditures that may arise in connection with
integration;

• the need to implement internal controls, procedures, and policies
appropriate for a larger, U.S.-based public company at companies that prior
to acquisition may not have as robust controls, procedures, and policies, in
particular, with respect to the effectiveness of internal controls, cyber
and information security practices and incident response plans, compliance
with privacy and other regulations protecting the rights of clients and
users, and compliance with U.S.-based economic policies and sanctions which
may not have previously been applicable to the acquired company’s
operations;

• the difficulty in accurately forecasting and accounting for the financial
impact of an acquisition transaction, including accounting charges, write-
offs of deferred revenue under purchase accounting, and integrating and
reporting results for acquired companies that have not historically followed
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP);

• the implementation of restructuring actions and cost reduction initiatives
to streamline operations and improve cost efficiencies;

• the fact that we may be required to pay contingent consideration in excess
of the initial fair value, and contingent consideration may become payable
at a time when we do not have sufficient cash available to pay such
consideration;

• in the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations
across different cultures and languages and to address the particular
economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific
countries as well as tax risks that may arise from the acquisition;

• increasing legal, regulatory, and compliance exposure, and the additional
costs related to mitigate each of those, as a result of adding new offices,
employees and other service providers, benefit plans, equity, job types, and
lines of business globally; and

• liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition,
including intellectual property, commercial, and other litigation claims or
disputes, cyber and information security vulnerabilities, violations of
laws, rules and regulations, including with respect to employee
classification, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities.

If we are unable to successfully integrate and manage our acquisitions and
strategic partnerships, we may not realize the expected benefits of such
transactions or become exposed to additional liabilities, and our business,
financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.

We plan to continue to expand and diversify our operations through strategic
acquisitions and partnerships. We face a number of risks related to these
transactions.

We plan to continue to expand and diversify our operations with additional
strategic acquisitions or partnerships, strategic collaborations, joint
ventures, or licensing arrangements. As we continue to grow, these
transactions may be larger and require significant investments, such as our
acquisitions of Machine Zone and Adjust, and our pending acquisition of the
MoPub business. We may be unable to identify or complete prospective
acquisitions or partnerships for many reasons, including our ability to
identify suitable targets, increasing competition from other potential
acquirers, the effects of consolidation in our industries, potentially high
valuations of acquisition candidates, and the availability of financing to
complete larger acquisitions. Even if we do complete any such transactions,
we may incur significant costs, such as professional service fees. In
addition, applicable antitrust laws and other regulations may limit our
ability to acquire targets, particularly larger targets, or force us to
divest an acquired business. If we are unable to identify suitable targets
or complete acquisitions, our growth prospects could be adversely affected,
and we may not be able to realize sufficient scale and technological
advantages to compete effectively in all markets.

Further, completing larger acquisitions or other strategic transactions is
significantly riskier in that such transactions require additional
consideration and management attention to complete, and could introduce
additional exposure to regulatory and compliance risk. To complete these
transactions, we may need to spend large amounts of cash, which may not be
available to us on acceptable terms, if at all, or issue equity or equity-
linked consideration, which may dilute our current stockholders. For
example, in connection with our acquisition of Adjust
                                     55                                     
Table of contents
in April 2021, we issued convertible securities that converted into an
aggregate of 6,320,688 shares of our Class A common stock. Further, we
generally devote more time and resources towards performing diligence on
larger transactions and may be required to devote more resources towards
regulatory requirements in connection with such transactions. To the extent
that we do not perform sufficient diligence on a larger acquisition or such
a transaction does not generate the expected benefits, our business,
financial condition, and results of operations will be harmed, and to a
greater extent than would occur with a smaller transaction.

Absent such strategic transactions, we would need to undertake additional
development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect
to fund and undertake such additional efforts on our own, we may need to
obtain additional expertise and additional capital, which may not be
available to our company on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to
do any of the foregoing, we may not be able to develop our Core
Technologies, Software Platform, and Apps effectively or achieve our
expected product roadmap on a timely basis, which could adversely affect our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.

The benefits of a strategic acquisition or partnership may also take
considerable time to develop, and we cannot be certain that any particular
strategic acquisition or partnership will produce the intended benefits.
Further, acquisitions could result in potential dilutive issuances of equity
securities, use of significant cash balances or incurrence of debt (and
increased interest expense), contingent liabilities or amortization expenses
related to intangible assets, or write-offs of goodwill and intangible
assets. If we are unable to identify and complete strategic acquisitions or
partnerships, our business, financial condition, and results of operations
could be adversely affected.
Our strategic acquisitions and partnerships may expose us to tax risks.
From time to time, we have acquired and may acquire companies, assets,
businesses, and technologies and we have entered into and may enter into
other strategic partnerships and transactions. We face a variety of tax
risks related to such transactions, including that we may be required to
make tax withholdings in various jurisdictions in connection with such
transactions or as part of our continuing operations following a
transaction, and that the companies or businesses we acquire may cause us to
alter our international tax structure or otherwise create more complexity
with respect to tax matters. Additionally, while we typically include
indemnification provisions in our definitive agreements related to strategic
acquisitions and partnerships, these indemnification provisions may be
insufficient in the event that tax liabilities are greater than expected or
in areas that are not fully covered by indemnification. If we are unable to
adequately predict and address such tax issues as they arise, our business,
financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.

We have entered into strategic partnerships with mobile gaming studios, and
a failure to maintain such relationships may harm our ability to launch new
Apps as well as our brand and reputation.

From time to time, we have entered into strategic partnerships with mobile
gaming studios (our Partner Studios). We have historically allowed these
Partner Studios to continue their operations with a degree of autonomy. In
certain of these transactions, we have bought games from such Partner
Studios and entered into development agreements whereby such Partner Studios
provide us support in developing and improving games and grant us a right of
first refusal with respect to future games. These agreements typically have
a fixed term, after which our Partner Studios may choose not to continue
working with us. Any deterioration in our relationship with these Partner
Studios may harm our ability to monetize the games we purchase and launch
future mobile games developed by these Partner Studios and may lead to such
Partner Studios choosing not to renew their partnerships with us. Further,
if a Partner Studio becomes dissatisfied with us, our brand and reputation
may be harmed and we may have more difficulty entering into similar
partnerships in the future. Additionally, our international Partner Studios
may be located in areas with less certain legal and regulatory regimes or
more potential risks, which may increase our costs to maintain such
strategic partnership. If we are unable to maintain any of these
partnerships, we may be required to invest significant resources in
expanding our other studios or entering into agreements with additional
mobile gaming studios in order to continue producing the same volume and
quality of Apps, and our business, financial condition, and results of
operations could be adversely affected.

We rely on third-party platforms to distribute our Apps and collect revenue,
and if our ability to do so is harmed, or such third-party platforms change
their policies in such a way that restricts our business, increases our
expenses, or limits the information we derive from our Apps, our business,
financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.

The mobile app ecosystem depends in part on a relatively small number of
third-party distribution platforms, such as the Apple App Store, the Google
Play Store, and Facebook, some of which are direct competitors. We derive
significant revenue from the distribution of our Apps through these third-
party platforms and almost all of our IAPs are made through the payment
processing systems of these third-party platforms. We are subject to the
                                     56                                     
Table of contents
standard policies and terms of service of such third-party platforms, which
generally govern the promotion, distribution, content, and operation of
applications on such platforms. Each platform provider has broad discretion
to change and interpret its terms of service and other policies with respect
to us and other mobile app companies, and those changes may be unfavorable
to us. A platform provider may also change its fee structure, add fees
associated with access to and use of its platform, alter how mobile apps are
labeled or are able to advertise on its platform, change how the personal
information of its users is made available to developers on its platform,
limit the use of personal information for advertising purposes, restrict how
users can share information on its platform or across platforms, or
significantly increase the level of compliance or requirements necessary to
use its platform. For example, in June 2020, Apple announced a plan to
overhaul IDFA as part of a new proposed application tracking transparency
framework that, among other things, would require opt-in consent for certain
types of tracking. This transparency framework, which began being rolled out
in late April 2021, has had a limited impact and may in the future have an
impact on the effectiveness of our advertising practices and/or our ability
to efficiently generate revenue for our Apps.We rely in part on IDFA to
provide us with data that helps our Software Platform better market and
monetize Apps. The proposed IDFA and transparency changes may require us to
engage in significant changes to our data collection practices, which may
require our expenditure of substantial costs and resources, and to the
extent we are unable to utilize IDFA or a similar offering, or if the
transparency changes and any related opt-in or other requirements result in
decreases in the availability or utility of data relating to Apps, our
Software Platform may not be as effective, we may not be able to continue to
efficiently generate revenue for our Apps, and our revenue and results of
operations may be harmed. Additionally, Apple implemented new requirements
for consumer disclosures regarding privacy and data processing practices in
December 2020, which has resulted in increased compliance requirements but
to date has not resulted in any significant decrease in the usage of our
Apps. These or any similar changes to the policies of Apple or Google may
materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and
results of operations.

If we violate, or a distribution platform provider believes we have
violated, a distribution platform’s terms of service, or if there is any
change or deterioration in our relationship with such distribution provider,
that platform provider could limit or discontinue our access to its
platform. For example, in August 2020, Apple and Google removed a mobile
game developed by one of our competitors from their platforms for violating
their standard policies and terms of service. If one of our distribution
platform partners were to limit or discontinue the distribution of our Apps
on their platform, it could adversely affect our business, financial
condition, and results of operations.

We also rely on the continued popularity, user adoption, and functionality
of third-party platforms. In the past, some of these platform providers have
been unavailable for short periods of time or experienced issues with their
in-app purchasing functionality. In addition, third-party platforms also
impose certain file size limitations, which may limit the ability of users
to download some of our larger Apps in over-the-air updates. Aside from
these over-the-air file size limitations, a larger game file size could
cause users to delete our mobile games once the file size grows beyond the
capacity of their devices’ storage limitations or could reduce the number of
downloads of these mobile games.

If issues arise with third-party platforms that impact the visibility or
availability of our Apps, our users’ ability to access our Apps or our
ability to monetize our Apps, or otherwise impact the design or
effectiveness of our Software Platform, our business, financial condition,
and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Our revenue has been concentrated in various ways and the loss of, or a
significant reduction in, any such revenue source, or our failure to
successfully expand and diversify our revenue sources could adversely affect
our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We have historically experienced revenue concentration with respect to
certain Apps as well as other facets of our business. Our future success
depends, in part, on launching or acquiring and successfully monetizing
additional Apps and on establishing and maintaining successful relationships
with a diverse set of business clients. While our Apps consist of over 350
mobile games, currently a limited number of those are responsible for a
significant portion of our revenue. I n the nine months ended September 30,
2021, three games, Project Makeover, Matchington Mansion and Wordscapes,
collectively represented approximately 31% of our revenue. The loss or
failure to successfully monetize one of these Apps could have a significant
impact on our results of operations. Similarly, our future success depends,
in part, on the ability of our Owned Studios and Partner Studios to launch
and monetize additional mobile games and other mobile apps, as well as, on
our ability to successfully acquire and monetize additional mobile games and
other mobile apps, and these Apps may not successfully diversify our revenue
concentration. If we are unable to successfully launch or acquire new Apps,
our reliance on a limited number of Apps may increase. Additionally, certain
genres of games typically rely on only a small portion of their total users
for a significant amount of their revenue, and as we expand our number of
Apps in these genres, such as mid-core, we
                                     57                                     
Table of contents
may experience these effects and need to attract, engage, and increase the
spending levels of these particular users to achieve success.

More generally, we face concentration risk in that our Software Platform and
Apps operate in the mobile app ecosystem and specifically mobile gaming. As
such, our business depends, in part, on the continued health and growth of
these app ecosystems. Further, a significant amount of our total revenue is
derived through a limited number of third-party distribution platforms, such
as the Apple App Store, the Google Play Store, and Facebook. Because
Facebook and Google are also significant partners of Adjust, a deterioration
in our or Adjust’s relationship with such companies would have a greater
impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. If
any of these concentrated portions of our revenue are harmed or are lost,
our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be
adversely affected.
We have experienced recent rapid growth, which may not be indicative of our
future growth. We may be unable to effectively manage the growth of our
business, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition,
and results of operations.
We have experienced rapid growth in the scale, scope, and complexity of our
business. For example, while we only launched our Apps in 2018, today, our
Apps consist of a globally diversified portfolio of over 350 free-to-play
mobile games across five genres, run by eighteen studios. Our growth in any
prior period should not be relied upon as an indication of our future
performance, as we may not be able to sustain our growth rate in the future.
Even if our revenue continues to increase, we expect that our revenue growth
rate may decline in the future as a result of a variety of factors,
including because of more difficult comparisons to prior periods and the
saturation of the market. The overall growth of our revenue depends in part
on our ability to execute on our growth strategies.

Additionally, the growth and expansion of our business has placed and
continues to place a significant strain on our management, operations,
financial infrastructure, and corporate culture. Our future success depends
in part on our ability to manage this expanded business and to continue to
grow both our Software Platform and Apps. If not managed effectively, this
growth could result in the over-extension of our management systems and
information technology systems and our internal controls and procedures may
not be adequate to support this growth. Failure to adequately manage our
growth in any of these ways may cause damage to our brand and reputation and
adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.
Our future growth may involve expansion into new business opportunities, and
any efforts to do so that are unsuccessful or are not cost-effective could
adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.
In the past, we have grown by expanding our offerings into new business
opportunities and we expect to continue to do so. We have dedicated
resources to expanding into adjacent business opportunities in which large
competitors have an established presence, as was the case with our Apps.
Additionally, our future growth may include expansion into additional genres
of mobile games, other mobile app sectors, or other opportunities which may
require significant investment in order to launch and which may not be prove
successful. Further, any such expansion may subject us to new or additional
laws and regulations, compliance with which may be burdensome and costly.
Our future growth depends in part on our ability to correctly identify areas
of investment and to cost-effectively execute on our plans. We have in the
past and may in the future expend significant resources in connection with
strategic acquisitions and partnerships to expand into new business
opportunities. Even if successful, the growth of any new business
opportunity could create significant challenges for our management and
operational resources and could require considerable investment. The
deployment of significant resources towards a new opportunity that proves
unsuccessful, or our inability to choose the correct investment
opportunities for our future, could adversely affect our business, financial
condition, and results of operations.

Our international operations are subject to increased challenges and risks.

We expect to continue to expand our international operations in the future
by opening new offices, entering into strategic partnerships with new
international game studios, acquiring companies that may have international
operations, and providing our Apps in additional countries and languages.
For example, our studios that we own (Owned Studios) and others that we
partner with (Partner Studios) are located throughout the world, including
in areas with less certain legal and regulatory regimes or more potential
risks, such as China and Vietnam. Expanding our international operations may
subject us to risks associated with:

• recruiting and retaining talented and capable management and employees in
foreign countries;

• the diversion of senior management attention;

• challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences;
                                     58                                     
Table of contents
• developing and customizing Software Platform and Apps that appeal to the
tastes and preferences of users in international markets;

• the inability to offer certain Software Platform or Apps in certain
foreign countries;

• competition from local mobile app developers with intellectual property
rights and significant market share in those markets and with a better
understanding of user preferences;

• utilizing, protecting, defending, and enforcing our intellectual property
rights;

• negotiating agreements with local distribution platforms that are
sufficiently economically beneficial to us and protective of our rights;

• the inability to extend proprietary rights in our brand, content, or
technology into new jurisdictions;

• implementing alternative payment methods for features and virtual goods in
a manner that complies with local laws and practices and protects us from
fraud;

• compliance with applicable foreign laws and regulations, including anti-
bribery laws, privacy laws, and laws relating to content and consumer
protection (for example, the United Kingdom’s Office of Fair Trading’s 2014
principles relating to IAPs in free-to-play games that are directed toward
children 16 and under);

• credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud;

• currency exchange rate fluctuations;

• protectionist laws and business practices that favor local businesses in
certain countries;

• double taxation of our international earnings and potentially adverse tax
consequences due to changes in the tax laws in the United States or the
foreign jurisdictions in which we operate;

• political, economic, and social instability;

• public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which can result in
varying impacts to our employees, clients, users, advertisers, app
developers, and business partners internationally;

• higher costs associated with doing business internationally, including
costs related to local advisors;

• export or import regulations; and

• trade and tariff restrictions.

Our ability to successfully gain market acceptance in any particular
international market is uncertain and, in the past, we have experienced
difficulties and have not been successful in all the countries we have
entered. If we are unable to continue to expand internationally or manage
the complexity of our global operations successfully, our business,
financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Our business depends in part on our ability to increase in-app purchases,
manage the economies in our Apps and respond to changes with respect to in-
app purchases, and any failure to do so could adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.

Our business and future growth depend in part on our ability to increase the
amount of IAPs in our Apps, which requires our studios to effectively design
mobile games and other apps that create features and virtual goods for which
users will pay. Users make IAPs because of the perceived in-app value of
virtual goods, which is dependent on the relative ease of obtaining an
equivalent good by playing our mobile games. The perceived in-app value of
these virtual goods can be impacted by various actions that we take in the
mobile games including offering discounts for virtual goods, giving away
virtual goods in promotions, or providing easier non-paid means to secure
these goods. Managing virtual economies is difficult and relies on our
assumptions and judgement. Further, changes in user preferences, including
with respect to how they interact with mobile apps and general views towards
IAPs, could decrease levels of spending on IAPs on our Apps and in the
mobile app ecosystem generally. If we fail to manage our virtual economies
properly or fail to promptly and successfully respond to any disruption in
such economies, our reputation may be harmed and our users may be less
likely to play our mobile games and to purchase virtual goods from us in the
future, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and
results of operations.

In addition, changes in the policies of Apple, Google, or other third-party
platforms, or changes in accounting policies promulgated by the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC), and national accounting standards bodies
                                     59                                     
Table of contents
affecting software and virtual goods revenue recognition, could further
significantly affect the way we report revenue related to IAPs, which could
adversely affect our results of operations. Any changes in user, third-party
platform, or regulator views towards IAPs, or any inability by us to respond
to changing trends with respect to IAPs, could adversely affect our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We are highly dependent on our co-founder and chief executive officer, as
well as our senior management team, and our business and growth may be
adversely affected if we fail to attract, retain, and motivate key
personnel.

Our future success depends in significant part on the continued service of
our key management and engineering personnel, including our co-founder, CEO,
and Chairperson, Adam Foroughi. Our ability to compete and grow depends in
part on the efforts and talents of these employees and executives, who are
important to our vision, strategic direction, culture, products, and
technology. We do not have employment agreements, other than offer letters,
with Mr. Foroughi or other members of our senior management team, and we do
not maintain key-man insurance for members of our senior management team.
The loss of Mr. Foroughi or any other member of our senior management team
could cause disruption and adversely affect our business, financial
condition, or results of operations.

In addition, our ability to execute our strategy depends in part on our
continued ability and the continued ability of our Partner Studios to
identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly skilled employees,
particularly in the competitive fields of game development, product
management, engineering, and data science. We believe that our corporate
culture has been an important factor in our ability to hire and retain key
employees, and if we are unable to maintain our corporate culture as we
grow, we may be unable to foster the innovation, creativity, and teamwork we
believe we need to support our growth. While we believe we compete
favorably, competition for highly skilled employees is intense, particularly
in the San Francisco Bay Area, where our headquarters is located.
Interviewing, hiring, and integrating new employees has been and will
continue to be particularly challenging during the COVID-19 pandemic. As
part of our global remote working plans, throughout the duration of the
COVID-19 pandemic, we have and will continue to devote increased efforts to
maintaining our collaborative culture, including through the use of
videoconferencing and other online communication and sharing tools, and to
monitoring the health, safety, morale, and productivity of our employees,
including new employees, as we evaluate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic
on our business and employees. If we are unable to identify, hire, and
retain highly skilled employees, our business, financial condition, and
results of operations could be adversely affected.

We have historically hired a number of key personnel and added additional
team members working on our Apps through strategic acquisitions and
partnerships, and as competition within the mobile app ecosystem for
attractive target companies with a skilled employee base persists and
increases, we may incur significant expenses and difficulty in continuing
this practice. The loss of talented employees with experience in the assets
we acquire could result in significant disruptions to our business and the
integration of acquired assets and businesses. If we do not succeed in
recruiting, retaining, and motivating these key employees, we may not
achieve the anticipated results of acquisitions.

Security breaches, improper access to or disclosure of our data or user
data, other hacking and phishing attacks on our systems, or other cyber
incidents could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business.

The mobile app ecosystem is prone to cyberattacks by third parties seeking
unauthorized access to our data or the data of our clients or users or to
disrupt our ability to provide service. Our Software Platform, Apps, and
other offerings involve the collection, storage, processing, and
transmission of a large amount of data, including personal information, and
we and our third-party service providers otherwise store and process
information, including our confidential and proprietary business
information, and personal information and other information relating to our
employees and business clients or other third parties. We also store and
implement measures designed to secure the source code for our Software
Platform and Apps as they are created. Any failure to prevent or mitigate
security breaches or incidents impacting our systems or other systems used
in our business, or improper access to or disclosure of our data, including
source code, or user data, including personal information, content, or
payment information from users, or information from business clients or
other third parties, that is stored or otherwise processed in our business
could result in the unauthorized loss, modification, disclosure,
destruction, or other misuse of such data, or unavailability of data or of
our Software Platform, Apps, or other offerings. Any such event, or the
perception it has occurred, could adversely affect our business and
reputation, damage our operations, result in claims, litigation or
regulatory investigations or enforcement actions, fines, penalties, or other
liability or obligations, and diminish our competitive position. In
particular, a breach or incident, whether physical, electronic, or
otherwise, impacting systems on which source code or other sensitive data
are stored could lead to loss, disruption,
                                     60                                     
Table of contents
unavailability, or piracy of, or damage to, our offerings, lost or reduced
ability to protect our intellectual property, and diminished competitive
position.

Computer malware (including ransomware), viruses, social engineering
(predominantly spear phishing attacks or credential stuffing), and general
hacking have become more prevalent in the mobile app ecosystem. Some of
these have occurred on our systems and otherwise in our business in the
past, and we expect will continue to occur in the future. We regularly
encounter attempts to create false or undesirable user accounts or take
other actions for purposes such as spamming or other objectionable ends. Any
actual or attempted breaches, incidents, or attacks may cause disruptions or
interruptions to our Software Platform, Apps, or other offerings, degrade
the user experience, impair, disrupt, or interrupt our internal systems and
other systems and networks used in our business, or adversely affect our
reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our
efforts to protect our data, user data, and information from clients,
partners, and other third parties, and to disable or otherwise respond to
undesirable activities on our Software Platform, Apps, or other offerings,
may also be unsuccessful due to software bugs or other technical defects,
errors, or malfunctions; employee, contractor, vendor, or partner error or
malfeasance, including defects or vulnerabilities in information technology
systems or offerings; cyberattacks, attacks designed to disrupt systems or
facilities, or breaches of physical security of our facilities or technical
infrastructure; or other threats that evolve. Additionally, any such breach,
incident, attack, malfunction, defect, or vulnerability, or the perception
that any of these has occurred, may cause clients or users to lose and
confidence and trust in our Software Platform or Apps and otherwise harm our
reputation and market position.

In addition, some developers or other business partners, such as those that
help us measure the effectiveness of advertisements, may receive or store
information provided by us or by our users through mobile or web apps or
other means. These third parties may misappropriate our information and
engage in unauthorized use of it. If these third parties fail to adopt or
adhere to adequate data security practices, or experience a breach of, or
other security incident impacting, their networks or systems, our data or
our users’ data may be improperly accessed, modified, disclosed, or
otherwise misused. In such an event, or if such an event is perceived to
have occurred, we may suffer damage to our reputation, may have increased
costs arising from the restoration or implementation of additional security
measures, and we may face claims, demands, investigations and other
proceedings by private parties or governmental actors, and fines, penalties,
and other liability or obligations, any of which could adversely affect our
business, financial condition, and results of operations. Any theft or
unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential
business information as a result of such an event could also adversely
affect our business, competitive position, and results of operations.

Cyberattacks continue to evolve in sophistication and volume, and inherently
may be difficult to detect for long periods of time. Although we have
developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our data, user
data, and information from our partners; to prevent data loss, disable
undesirable accounts and activities on our Software Platform or Apps; and to
prevent and detect security breaches; we cannot assure you that such
measures will provide comprehensive security, that we will be able to
identify breaches or other incidents or to react to them in a timely manner
or that our remediation efforts will be successful. We experience
cyberattacks and other security incidents of varying degrees from time to
time, and we may incur significant costs in investigating, protecting
against, litigating, or remediating such incidents. We may face increased
risks of cyberattacks and other security incidents during the COVID-19
pandemic as a result of more employees working remotely, our use of third-
party systems designed to enable the transition to a remote workforce
introducing security risks and increased cyberattacks, such as phishing
attacks by threat actors using the attention placed on the COVID-19 pandemic
as a method for targeting personnel.

Additionally, our Software Platform and other offerings operate in
conjunction with, and we are dependent upon, third-party products, services,
and components. Our ability to monitor our third-party service providers’
data security is limited, and in any event, attackers may be able to
circumvent our third-party service providers’ data security measures. There
have been and may continue to be significant attacks on certain third-party
providers, and we cannot guarantee that our or our third-party providers’
systems and networks have not been breached or that they do not contain
exploitable defects or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption
to our systems and networks or the systems and networks of third parties
that support us and our platform and service. If there is a security
vulnerability, error, or other bug in one of these third-party products,
services, and components and if there is a security exploit targeting them,
we could face increased costs, claims, liability, and additional or new
obligations, reduced revenue, and harm to our reputation or competitive
position. We and our service providers may be unable to anticipate these
techniques, react, remediate or otherwise address any security
vulnerability, breach or other security incident in a timely manner, or
implement adequate preventative measures.

In addition to our efforts to mitigate cybersecurity risks, we are making
significant investments in privacy, safety, security, and content review
efforts to combat misuse of our services and user data by third parties. As
a
                                     61                                     
Table of contents
result of these efforts, we anticipate that we will discover incidents of
misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties. We may
not discover all such incidents or activity, whether as a result of our data
limitations, the scale of activity on our Software Platform, challenges
related to our personnel working remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, the
re-allocation of resources to other projects, or other factors, and we may
be notified of such incidents or activity by users, the media, or other
third parties. Such incidents and activities have in the past, and may in
the future, include the use or other processing of user data or our systems
in a manner inconsistent with our terms, contracts or policies, the
existence of false or undesirable user accounts, improper advertising
practices, activities that threaten people’s safety on- or offline or
instances of spamming, scraping, data harvesting, or unsecured datasets. We
may also be unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our policies or otherwise
remediate or respond to any such incidents effectively or in a timely
manner. Any of the foregoing developments, or any reports of them occurring
or the perception that any of them has occurred, could adversely affect user
trust and engagement, harm our brand and reputation, require us to change
our business practices, result in claims, demands, investigations, and other
proceedings by private parties or governmental actors, and fines, penalties,
and other liability or obligations, and adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.

We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and
abroad relating to cybersecurity and data protection, a number of which also
provide a private right of action. Affected users or government authorities
could initiate legal or regulatory actions against us in connection with any
actual or perceived security breaches or improper access to or disclosure of
data, which has occurred in the past and which could cause us to incur
significant expense and liability, distract management and technical
personnel, and result in orders or consent decrees forcing us to modify our
business practices. Such actual or perceived incidents or our efforts to
remediate such incidents may also result in a decline in our active user
base or engagement levels. Any of these events could adversely affect our
reputation, business, financial condition, or results of operations.

Our insurance coverage may not extend to all types of privacy and data
security breaches or other incidents, and it may be insufficient to cover
all costs and expenses associated with such incidents. Further, such
insurance may not continue to be available to us in the future on
economically reasonable terms, or at all, and insurers may deny us coverage
as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims
against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of
changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the
imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a
material adverse effect on our business, including our reputation, financial
condition, or results of operations.

We anticipate increasing our operating expenses in the future, and we may
not be able to achieve or maintain our profitability in any given period. If
we cannot achieve or maintain our profitability, our business could be
adversely affected.

Although we have been profitable on a GAAP basis and had positive cash flow
from operations in certain prior periods, we may not always achieve
sufficient revenue or manage our expenses in order to achieve positive cash
flow from operations or profitability in any given period. Our operating
expenses may continue to rise as we implement additional initiatives
designed to increase revenue, potentially including: developing our Software
Platform and technology stack, expanding our Software Platform, launching
Apps, strategic acquisitions and partnerships, business client and user
acquisition spending, international expansion, hiring additional employees,
and taking other steps to strengthen and grow our company. We are likely to
recognize costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the
anticipated benefits, and the return on these investments may be lower, or
may develop more slowly, than we expect. We also anticipate that the costs
of acquiring new business clients and mobile app users, and otherwise
marketing our Software Platform and Apps, will continue to rise. Further, we
may continue to incur significant costs in connection with strategic
acquisitions and partnerships, which costs may increase or become more
concentrated to the extent we enter into larger transactions. If we are not
able to maintain positive cash flow in the long term, we may require
additional financing, which may not be available on favorable terms or at
all, and which may be dilutive to our stockholders. If we are unable to
generate adequate revenue growth and manage our expenses, we may incur
significant losses in the future and may not be able to maintain positive
cash flow from operations or profitability.

Our Software Platform and Apps, as well as our internal systems, rely on
software and hardware that is highly technical, and any errors, bugs, or
vulnerabilities in these systems, or failures to address or mitigate
technical limitations in our systems, could adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.

Our Software Platform and Apps, as well as our internal systems, rely on
software and hardware that is highly technical and complex. In addition, our
Software Platform and Apps, as well as our internal systems, depend in part
on the ability of such software and hardware to store, retrieve, process,
and manage immense amounts of data. The
                                     62                                     
Table of contents
software and hardware on which we rely has contained, and will in the future
contain, errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities and our systems are subject to
certain technical limitations that may compromise our ability to meet our
objectives. Some errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities inherently may be
difficult to detect and may only be discovered after the code has been
released for external or internal use. Errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, design
defects, or technical limitations within the software and hardware on which
we rely have in the past led to, and may in the future lead to, outcomes
including a negative experience for clients and users who use our offerings,
compromised ability of our offerings to perform in a manner consistent with
our terms, contracts, or policies, delayed product or App launches or
enhancements, targeting, measurement, or billing errors, compromised ability
to protect the data of our users and/or our intellectual property, or
reductions in our ability to provide some or all of our services. To the
extent such errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, or defects impact our Software
Platform or the accuracy of data in any such Software Platform, our clients
may become dissatisfied with our offerings, our brand and reputation may be
harmed, and we may make operational decisions, such as with respect to our
Apps using such Software Platform or any future strategic acquisition, that
are based on inaccurate data. Any errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, or defects
in our systems or the software and hardware on which we rely, failures to
properly address or mitigate the technical limitations in our systems, or
associated degradations or interruptions of service or failures to fulfill
our commitments to our clients may lead to outcomes including damage to our
reputation, increased product engineering expenses, regulatory inquiries,
litigation, or liability for fines, damages, or other remedies, any of which
could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.

Our business depends in part on our ability to maintain and scale our
technical infrastructure, and any significant disruption to our Software
Platform or Apps could damage our reputation, result in a potential loss of
engagement, and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and
results of operations.

Our reputation and ability to attract and retain our business clients and
users depends in part on the reliable performance of our Software Platform
and Apps. We have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience,
interruptions in the availability or performance of our offerings from time
to time. Our systems may not be adequately designed or may not operate with
the reliability and redundancy necessary to avoid performance delays or
outages that could be harmful to our business. If our offerings are
unavailable when users attempt to access them, or if they do not load as
quickly as expected, users may not use our offerings as often in the future,
or at all, which could adversely affect our business and results of
operations. As we continue to grow, we will need an increasing amount of
technical infrastructure, including network capacity and computing power, to
continue to satisfy our needs and the needs of our business clients and
users. It is possible that we may fail to continue to effectively scale and
grow our technical infrastructure to accommodate these increased demands,
which may adversely affect our user engagement and revenue growth.
Additionally, we rely in part on third-party data centers and cloud hosting
infrastructure. Our business may be subject to interruptions, delays, or
failures resulting from natural disasters and other events outside of our
control that impact us or these third-party providers. If such an event were
to occur, users may be subject to service disruptions or outages and we may
not be able to recover our technical infrastructure and user data in a
timely manner to restart or provide our services. If we fail to efficiently
scale and manage our infrastructure, or if events disrupt our infrastructure
or those of our third-party providers, our business, financial condition,
and results of operations could be adversely affected.

The COVID-19 pandemic and responses thereto across the globe have altered
how individuals interact with each other and affected how we and our
business partners are operating, and the extent to which this situation will
impact our future results of operations remains uncertain.

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and resulting social distancing and shelter-
in-place orders put in place around the world have caused widespread
disruption in global economies, productivity, and financial markets and have
altered the way in which we conduct our day-to-day business.

The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and the various responses
thereto impact our business, operations, and results of operations will
depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately
predict, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic, including any
potential future waves of the pandemic; governmental, business, and
individual actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to
the pandemic; the effect on our clients; disruptions or restrictions on our
employees’ ability to work and travel; the availability and cost to access
the capital markets; and interruptions related to our cloud networking and
mobile app infrastructure and that impact our business partners, platform
providers, clients, and customer service and support providers. As a result
of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have temporarily closed some of our offices
around the world and implemented travel restrictions. While substantially
all of our business operations can be performed remotely and we are planning
reopening for certain offices, many of our employees are juggling additional
work-related and personal challenges. With the general shift to remote work,
we are able to tap into candidate pools previously unavailable to us, but
candidates have also sought increased flexibility and may have more options
available to
                                     63

them. We will continue to actively monitor the issues raised by the COVID-19
pandemic and may take further actions that alter our business operations,
including as may be required by federal, state, local, or foreign
authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees,
users, business partners, and stockholders.

In addition to the potential direct impacts to our business, the global
economy has been, and is likely to continue to be, significantly weakened as
a result of the actions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and
future government intervention remains uncertain. A weakened global economy
may negatively impact our business partners as well as our users’ in-app
purchasing decisions and users’ buying decisions across the globe generally,
which could adversely affect advertiser activity. We may experience
heightened levels of variability in the pricing of advertising both in terms
of user acquisition and as it relates to our Software Platform and Apps. If
these conditions result in significant decreased pricing of advertising, the
revenue we make from our Software Platform and advertisers paying to display
advertisements in our Apps could be adversely affected, particularly if the
levels of user engagement in our Apps are not sufficient to offset these
declines, and we may experience increased pressure on our overall margins.
If we are not able to respond to and manage the direct and indirect impact
of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, then our business, financial
condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.
Our company culture has contributed to our success and if we cannot maintain
this culture as we grow, our business could be harmed.
We believe that our company culture has been critical to our success and
will be important for our continued growth. We face a number of challenges
that may affect our ability to sustain our corporate culture, including:
failure to identify, attract, reward, and retain people in leadership
positions in our organization who share and further our culture and values;
the increasing size and geographic diversity of our workforce; competitive
pressures to move in directions that may divert us from our culture and
values; the continued challenges of a rapidly-evolving industry; the
increasing need to develop expertise in new areas of business that affect
us; a negative perception of our treatment of employees or our response to
employee sentiment related to political or social causes or actions of
management; and the integration of new personnel and businesses from
acquisitions. If we are not able to maintain our culture, we could lose the
innovation, passion, and dedication of our team and as a result, our
business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely
affected.

If we do not successfully or cost-effectively invest in, establish, and
maintain awareness of the AppLovin brand, our business, financial condition,
and results of operations could be adversely affected.

We believe that establishing and maintaining the AppLovin brand is critical
to maintaining and creating favorable relationships with, and our ability to
attract, new business clients, particularly Enterprise Clients, and key
personnel. Increasing awareness of the AppLovin brand will depend largely
upon our marketing efforts and our ability to successfully differentiate our
Software Platform from the offerings of our competitors. In addition,
successfully globalizing and extending our brand requires significant
investment and extensive management time. If we fail to maintain and
increase brand awareness and recognition of our Software Platform, our
business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely
affected.
We generally do not have long-term agreements with our business clients.
Our business clients are not required to enter into long-term agreements
with us and may choose to stop using our Software Platform at any time. For
example, our advertising agreements can be executed in as little as one day
and can be terminated for convenience on two days’ notice. In order to
continue to grow our Software Platform, we must consistently provide
offerings that clients see as valuable and choose to use. If we fail to
maintain our relationships with our clients, or if the terms of these
relationships become less favorable to us, our results of operations would
be harmed. Additionally, as certain of our Enterprise Clients are also our
competitors, these clients may choose to invest in their own offerings
rather than continue to use our Software Platform. Any failure to maintain
our relationships with business clients could adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.

If our Apps do not meet user expectations, or contain objectionable content,
our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations
could be adversely affected.

Expectations regarding the quality, performance, and integrity of our Apps
are high. We must continually adapt to changing user preferences including
the popularity of various game categories, style of play, and IAP options.
Users may be critical of our Apps, business models, or business practices
for a wide variety of reasons, including perceptions about gameplay,
fairness, game content, features, or services. Independent industry analysts
may publish reviews of our Apps from time to time, as well as those of our
competitors, and perception of our Apps in the marketplace may be
significantly influenced by these reviews. We have no control over what
users or these industry
                                     64                                     
Table of contents
analysts report. If users and industry analysts negatively respond to our
Apps or changes that we make to our Apps, or provide negative reviews of our
Apps, our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of
operations could be adversely affected.

Further, despite reasonable precautions, some users may be offended by
certain mobile app content, advertisements displayed in our Apps or by the
treatment of other users. For example, if users believe that an
advertisement displayed in an App contains objectionable content, we could
experience damage to our brand and reputation and users could refuse to play
such game and pressure platform providers to remove the App from their
platforms. While such content may violate our terms and we may subsequently
remove it, our brand and reputation may nonetheless be harmed and our
clients may become dissatisfied with our services. Furthermore, steps that
we may take in response to such instances, such as temporarily or
permanently shutting off access of a user to our Apps, could adversely
affect our business and results of operations. Any failure to meet user
expectations or provide our Apps without objectionable content could
adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, and results
of operations.

The proliferation of “cheating” programs and scam offers that seek to
exploit our mobile games and users may adversely affect game-playing
experiences and lead users to stop playing our mobile games. Our failure to
maintain a customer support ecosystem may enhance these risks.

Our users rely on our customer support organization to resolve any issues
relating to our mobile games. Customer support is important for satisfying
user expectations regarding the quality, performance, and integrity of our
mobile games. We currently have limited customer support operations, which
we recently acquired through Machine Zone. If we do not effectively train,
supplement, and manage our customer support organization to assist our
users, and if that support organization does not succeed in helping users
quickly resolve issues or provide effective ongoing support, we could
experience decreased user engagement and harm to our reputation with
potential new users.

Additionally, unrelated third parties have developed, and may continue to
develop, “cheating” programs that enable users to exploit vulnerabilities in
our mobile games, play them in an automated way, collude to alter the
intended game play, or obtain unfair advantages over other users who do play
fairly. These programs harm the experience of users who play fairly and may
disrupt the virtual economies of our mobile games and reduce the demand for
certain IAPs. In addition, unrelated third parties have attempted to scam
our users with fake offers for virtual goods or other game benefits. These
unauthorized or fraudulent transactions are usually arranged on third-party
websites and the virtual goods offered may have been obtained through
unauthorized means, such as exploiting vulnerabilities in our mobile games,
or may be fraudulent offers. We do not generate any revenue from these
transactions. These unauthorized purchases and sales from third-party
sellers have in the past and could in the future impede our revenue and
profit growth.

There can be no assurance that our customer support and other efforts to
detect, prevent, or minimize these unauthorized or fraudulent transactions
will be successful, that these actions will not increase over time or that
our customer support efforts will be successful in resolving user issues.
Any failure to maintain adequate customer support or success of third-party
cheating programs or scams may negatively affect game-playing experiences
and lead users to stop playing our mobile games, which could adversely
affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Our business is subject to economic, market, public health, and geopolitical
conditions as well as to natural disasters beyond our control.

Our business is subject to economic, market, public health, and geopolitical
conditions, as well as natural disasters beyond our control. Our revenue is
driven in part by discretionary consumer spending habits and preferences,
and by advertising spending patterns. Historically, consumer purchasing and
advertising spending have each declined during economic downturns and
periods of uncertainty regarding future economic prospects or when
disposable income or consumer lending is lower. General macro-economic
conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown in the United States or
internationally, including those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and
geopolitical issues, could create uncertainty and adversely affect
discretionary consumer spending habits and preferences as well as
advertising spending. Uncertain economic conditions may also adversely
affect our business clients. As a result, we may be unable to continue to
grow in the event of future economic slowdowns. We are particularly
susceptible to market conditions and risks associated with the mobile app
ecosystem, which also include the popularity, price, and timing of our Apps,
changes in user demographics, the availability and popularity of other forms
of entertainment, and critical reviews and public tastes and preferences,
which may change rapidly and cannot necessarily be predicted.

Additionally, our principal offices are located in the San Francisco Bay
Area, an area known for earthquakes and susceptible to fires, and are thus
vulnerable to damage. All of our facilities are also vulnerable to damage
from natural or manmade disasters, including power loss, earthquakes, fires,
explosions, floods, communications failures, terrorist attacks, contagious
disease outbreak (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), and similar events. If any
disaster were to occur, our ability to operate our business at our
facilities could be impaired and we could incur significant losses, recovery
from which may require substantial time and expense.
                                                                            
  Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters                             
                                                                            
We are subject to laws and regulations concerning privacy, information
security, data protection, consumer protection, advertising, tracking,
targeting, and protection of minors, and these laws and regulations are
continually evolving. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with these
laws and regulations could adversely affect our business, financial
condition, and results of operations.

We receive, store, and process personal information and other data,
including data relating to individuals and households, and we enable our
users to share their personal information with each other and with third
parties, including within our Apps. There are numerous federal, state, and
local laws around the world regarding privacy and the collection, storing,
sharing, use, processing, disclosure, deletion, and protection of personal
information and other data, including data relating to individuals and
households, the scope of which are changing, subject to differing
interpretations, and may be inconsistent between countries or conflict with
other rules.

Various government and consumer agencies have called for new regulation and
changes in industry practices and are continuing to review the need for
greater regulation for the collection of information concerning consumer
behavior on the internet, including regulation aimed at restricting certain
targeted advertising practices. For example, the GDPR, which became
effective in May 2018, created new individual privacy rights and imposed
worldwide obligations on companies processing personal data of European
Union ("EU") users, which has created a greater compliance burden for us and
other companies with European users, and subjects violators to substantial
monetary penalties. The United Kingdom has implemented legislation that
substantially implements the GDPR and which also provides for substantial
monetary penalties. In June 2021, the European Commission announced a
decision of “adequacy” concluding that the United Kingdom ensures an
equivalent level of data protection to the GDPR, which provides some relief
regarding the legality of continued personal data flows from the European
Economic Area to the United Kingdom. Such adequacy decision must, however,
be renewed after four years and may be modified or revoked in the interim.
We cannot fully predict how United Kingdom data protection laws or
regulations may develop in the medium to longer term, nor the effects of
divergent laws and guidance regarding how data transfers to and from the
United Kingdom will be regulated.

With regard to transfers to the United States of personal data (as such term
is used in the GDPR and applicable EU member state legislation) from our
employees and European users and other third parties, we have relied upon
the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield as well as certain standard
contractual clauses approved by the EU Commission (the "SCCs"); however,
both the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and the SCCs have been subject to legal
challenge, and on July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the EU, Europe’s
highest court, held in the Schrems II case that the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield
was invalid, and imposed additional obligations in connection with the use
of the SCCs. This decision imposes restrictions on the ability to transfer
personal data from the EU and Switzerland to the United States, and with the
exit of the United Kingdom from the EU, we and other companies face
additional restrictions on transfers of personal data from the United
Kingdom. EU regulators since have issued additional guidance regarding these
additional requirements that we and other companies must consider and
undertake when using the SCCs. On June 4, 2021, the European Commission
adopted new SCCs, taking into account the Schrems II case and reflecting
requirements under the GDPR. The decision foresees an 18-month grace period
for companies to adopt the new SCCs, subject to obligations to use the SCCs
for new contracts and data processing operations as of September 27, 2021.
We are in the process of assessing these developments and their impact on
our data transfer mechanisms. The SCCs and other cross-border data transfer
mechanisms may face additional legal challenges or be the subject of
additional legislative activity and regulatory guidance. We and many other
companies may need to implement different or additional measures to
establish or maintain legitimate means for the transfer and receipt of
personal data from the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and the United
Kingdom to the United States, and we may, in addition to other impacts,
experience additional costs associated with increased compliance burdens,
and we and our clients face the potential for regulators to apply different
standards to the transfer of personal data from the European Economic Area,
Switzerland, and the United Kingdom to the United States, and to block, or
require ad hoc verification of measures taken with respect to, certain data
flows from the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom
to the United States. We also may be required to engage in contract
negotiations with third parties that aid in processing data on our behalf,
to the extent that any of our service providers, or consultants have been
relying on invalidated or insufficient contractual protections for
                                     66                                     
Table of contents
compliance with evolving interpretations of and guidance for cross-border
data transfers pursuant to the GDPR, Swiss privacy laws, and UK privacy
laws. In such cases, we may not be able to find alternative service
providers which could limit our ability to process personal data from the
European Economic Area, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom and increase our
costs and/or impact our Core Technologies, Software Platform, Apps, or other
offerin. We and our clients may face a risk of enforcement actions by data
protection authorities in the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and the
United Kingdom relating to personal data transfers. Any such enforcement
actions could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources,
distract management and technical personnel, and adversely affect our
business, financial condition, and results of operations. Similar to GDPR,
in September 2020, Brazil enacted the Brazilian General Data Protection Law
("LGPD") and in August 2021, China passed a new data privacy law known as
"PIPL", effective November 1, 2021. Any of these developments may have an
adverse effect on our business.

Moreover, the GDPR and other similar regulations require companies to give
specific types of notice and in some cases seek consent from consumers and
other data subjects before collecting or using their data for certain
purposes, including some marketing activities. In addition to the GDPR, the
European Commission has another draft regulation in the approval process
that focuses on a person’s right to conduct a private life. The proposed
legislation, known as the Regulation of Privacy and Electronic
Communications (ePrivacy Regulation), would replace the current ePrivacy
Directive. Originally planned to be adopted and implemented at the same time
as the GDPR, the ePrivacy Regulation is still being negotiated. In February
10, 2021, the Council of the EU agreed on its version of the draft ePrivacy
Regulation. If adopted, the earliest date for entry into force is in 2023,
with broad potential impacts on the use of internet-based services and
tracking technologies, such as cookies. Aspects of the ePrivacy Regulation
remain for negotiation between the European Commission and the Council.

Another example is the State of California’s passage of the CCPA, which went
into effect on January 1, 2020, with implementing regulations taking effect
August 14, 2020, and which created new privacy rights for users residing in
the state, including a private right of action for data breaches. The
California Privacy Rights Act (the "CPRA") was approved by California voters
in November 2020, goes into effect on January 1, 2023, and will
significantly modify the CCPA, potentially resulting in further uncertainty
and requiring us to incur additional costs and expenses in an effort to
comply. Additionally, other states appear to be following California's lead
and are considering new, comprehensive privacy legislation, some of which
contemplate private rights of action, which may increase the likelihood of
class action litigation, that could also adversely affect our reputation,
business, financial condition, and results operations. Nevada, Virginia, and
Colorado have similarly enacted comprehensive privacy laws - the Nevada
Privacy Law taking effect October 1, 2019, the Consumer Data Protection Act
taking effect on January 1, 2023, and the Colorado Privacy Act taking effect
on July 1, 2021, respectively - all of which emulate the CCPA and CPRA in
many respects. Our efforts to comply with the GDPR, CCPA, COPPA, and similar
legal requirements, such as the LGPD and the privacy laws of China, has
required us and will continue to require us to devote significant
operational resources and incur significant expenses. Our privacy and data
protection compliance and oversight efforts will require significant time
and attention from our management and board of directors.

Further, children’s privacy has been a focus of recent enforcement
activities and subjects our business to potential liability that could
adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.
Enforcement of COPPA, which requires companies to obtain parental consent
before collecting personal information from children known to be under the
age of thirteen or from child-directed websites or online services, has
increased in recent years. In addition, the GDPR prohibits certain
processing of the personal information of children under the age of thirteen
to sixteen (depending on jurisdiction) without parental consent where
consent is used as the lawful basis for processing that personal
information. The CCPA requires companies to obtain the consent of children
in California known to be under the age of sixteen (or parental consent for
children under the age of thirteen) before selling their personal
information. Although we take reasonable efforts to comply with these laws
and regulations, we may in the future face claims under COPPA, the GDPR, the
CCPA, or other laws relating to children’s privacy.

All of our mobile games are subject to privacy policies and terms of service
located in application storefronts, within our mobile games, and on our
respective websites. We endeavor to comply with industry standards and are
subject to the terms of our privacy-related obligations and commitments to
users and third parties. We strive to comply with all applicable laws,
policies, legal obligations, and certain industry codes of conduct relating
to privacy and data protection, to the extent reasonably attainable.
However, it is possible that these obligations may be interpreted and
applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another
and may conflict with other rules or our practices. It is also possible that
new laws, policies, legal obligations, or industry codes of conduct may be
passed, or existing laws, policies, legal obligations, or industry codes of
conduct may be interpreted in such a way that could prevent us from being
able to offer services to citizens of a certain jurisdiction or may make it
costlier or more difficult for us to do so. Any failure or perceived failure
by us to comply with laws and regulations concerning
                                     67                                     
Table of contents
privacy, information security, data protection, consumer protection, and
protection of minors; our privacy policy and terms of service; our or other
privacy-related obligations to users or other third parties, or our privacy-
related legal obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the
unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information or
other user data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation,
or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and
could cause our users to lose trust in us, which could adversely affect our
business, financial condition, or results of operations. Additionally, if
third parties we work with, such as users, developers, vendors, service
providers, or other business partners violate applicable laws or our
policies, such violations may also put our users’ information at risk and
could in turn adversely affect our reputation, business, financial
condition, and results of operations.

Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign laws, many of which
are unsettled and still developing, which could subject us to claims or
otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.

We are subject to a variety of laws in the United States and abroad that
affect our business, including state and federal laws regarding consumer
protection, electronic marketing, protection of minors, data protection, and
privacy, competition, taxation, intellectual property, money transmission,
money laundering, investment screening, export, and national security, which
are continuously evolving and developing. The scope and interpretation of
the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be
conflicting, particularly laws outside the United States. There is a risk
that existing or future laws may be interpreted in a manner that is not
consistent with our current practices and which could adversely affect our
business. As our Software Platform grows and evolves and our Software
Platform and our Apps are used in a greater number of countries, we may also
become subject to laws and regulations in additional jurisdictions or other
jurisdictions may claim that we are required to comply with their laws and
regulations.

With respect to our Apps, we are potentially subject to a number of foreign
and domestic laws and regulations that affect the offering of certain types
of content, such as content that depicts violence, the social casino game
genre, or loot boxes, many of which are ambiguous or still evolving and
could be interpreted in ways that could adversely affect our business or
expose us to liability. Some state attorney generals as well as other
international regulatory bodies have brought and may continue to bring legal
actions against social casino app developers and the third-party
distribution platforms for such apps. Further, several jurisdictions have
been regulating and continue to regulate the use of loot boxes in mobile
games. Loot boxes are a commonly used monetization technique in free-to-play
mobile games in which a user can acquire a virtual loot box, typically
through mobile game play or by using virtual goods, but the user does not
know which virtual good(s) he or she will receive (which may be a common,
rare, or extremely rare item, and may be a duplicate of an item the user
already has in his or her inventory) until the loot box is opened. The user
will always receive one or more virtual goods when he or she opens the loot
box, but the user does not know exactly which item(s) until the loot box is
opened. In April 2018, each of the Belgian Gaming Commission and the Dutch
Gambling Authority declared that loot boxes as implemented in certain games
by other companies that they reviewed constituted illegal gambling under
each country’s laws. Further, the Federal Trade Commission (the FTC) has
examined consumer protection issues related to loot boxes and various other
jurisdictions, including certain U.S. states, Australia, Brazil, and the
United Kingdom are reviewing or have indicated that they intend to review
the legality of loot boxes and whether they constitute gambling.
Additionally, in 2021, Germany approved a new Youth Protection Act, that
came into effect on May 1, 2021, which makes it unlawful to sell video games
that contain loot boxes to minors. In some of our mobile games, certain
mechanics may be deemed as “loot boxes”. New regulation by the FTC, U.S.
states, or other international jurisdictions could require that these game
mechanics be modified or removed from games or that such apps be changed
entirely, both of which could increase the costs of operating our mobile
games, impact user engagement and monetization, or otherwise adversely
affect our business. In addition, the increased attention focused upon
liability issues as a result of lawsuits and legislative proposals could
harm our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business. It is
difficult to predict how existing or new laws may be applied to these or
similar game mechanics or genres. Further, laws or regulations may vary
significantly across jurisdictions.

It is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted or
construed to apply to us in the United States and elsewhere that could
restrict the mobile app ecosystem, including user privacy, advertising,
communications, taxation, content suitability, copyright, distribution, and
antitrust. Furthermore, the growth and development of electronic commerce
and virtual goods may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection
laws that may impose additional burdens on companies such as ours conducting
business through the internet and mobile devices. For example, China
implemented a new policy in September 2021 that restricts online gaming for
those under age 18 to one hour in the evening on Fridays, weekends and
public holidays. We anticipate that scrutiny and regulation of our industry
will increase and we will be required to devote legal and other resources to
                                     68

addressing such regulation. For example, existing laws or new laws regarding
the marketing of IAPs, labeling of free-to-play mobile games, or regulation
of currency, banking institutions, unclaimed property or money transmission
may be interpreted to cover our mobile games and the virtual currency,
goods, or payments that we receive. We may also expand into new business
opportunities that subject us to additional laws and regulations. As such,
we may be required to seek licenses, authorizations, or approvals from
relevant regulators, the granting of which may be dependent on us meeting
certain capital and other requirements and we may be subject to additional
regulation and oversight, all of which could significantly increase our
operating costs. Changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of
new laws and regulations in the United States or elsewhere regarding these
activities may lessen the growth of the mobile app ecosystem. Any costs
incurred as a result of adapting to laws and regulations, or as a result of
liability in connection therewith, could adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.

We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and similar anti-
corruption and anti-bribery laws, and non-compliance with such laws could
subject us to criminal penalties or significant fines and adversely affect
our business and reputation.

We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the FCPA), the U.S.
domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. § 201, the U.S. Travel Act,
and similar anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws applicable in the
jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Anti-corruption and anti-bribery
laws have been enforced aggressively in recent years, are interpreted
broadly and prohibit companies, their employees, and third party business
partners, representatives, and agents from promising, authorizing, making or
offering improper payments or other benefits, directly or indirectly, to
government officials and others in the private sector in order to influence
official action, direct business to any person, gain any improper advantage,
or obtain or retain business. As we continue to expand our business
internationally, our risks under these laws increase.

We and our third-party business partners, representatives, and agents may
have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of
government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and we may be held
liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of our employees, third-
party business partners, representatives, and agents, even if we do not
explicitly authorize such activities. These laws also require that we keep
accurate books and records and maintain internal controls and compliance
procedures designed to prevent any such actions. While we have policies and
procedures to address compliance with such laws, we cannot assure you that
our employees, third-party business partners, representatives, and agents
will not take actions in violation of our policies or applicable law, for
which we may be ultimately held responsible and our exposure for violating
these laws increases as our international presence expands and as we
increase sales and operations in foreign jurisdictions.

Any violation of the FCPA or other applicable anti-corruption laws could
result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations,
loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions, suspension or
disbarment from U.S. government contracts, substantial diversion of
management’s attention, significant legal fees and fines, severe criminal or
civil sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, disgorgement of
profits, other sanctions and remedial measures, and prohibitions on the
conduct of our business, any of which could adversely affect our reputation,
business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We are subject to governmental export controls and economic sanctions laws
that could impair our ability to compete in global markets or subject us to
liability if we violate the controls.

Our Core Technologies, Software Platform, and Apps may be subject to U.S.
export controls. Exports of our products and the underlying technology may
require export authorizations, including by license, a license exception, or
other appropriate government authorizations, including the filing of an
encryption classification request or self-classification report, as
applicable.

Furthermore, our activities are subject to U.S. economic sanctions laws and
regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of
Foreign Assets Control that prohibit the shipment of most technologies to
embargoed jurisdictions or sanctioned parties without the required export
authorizations. If we need to obtain any necessary export license or other
authorization for a particular sale, the process may be time-consuming and
may result in the delay or loss of opportunities to sell our products.

We take precautions to prevent our products and the underlying technology
from being provided, deployed or used in violation of export control and
sanctions laws, including implementation of IP address blocking and
sanctioned person screening, and are in the process of further enhancing our
policies and procedures relating to export control and sanctions compliance.
However, we cannot assure you that our policies and procedures relating to
export control and sanctions compliance will prevent violations in the
future by us or our partners or agents. If we are found to be in violation

import, export, or re-export licenses or permits, it can result in
significant penalties and government investigations, as well as reputational
harm and loss of business. Knowing and willful violations can result in
possible incarcerations for responsible employees and managers.

In addition to the United States, various other countries regulate the
import and export of certain encryption and other technology, including
import and export licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could
limit our ability to distribute our products or could limit our clients’
ability to implement our products in those countries. Changes in our Core
Technologies, Software Platform, or Apps, or future changes in export and
import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products and
the underlying technology in international markets, prevent our clients with
global operations from deploying our products globally, or, in some cases,
prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries,
governments, or persons altogether. From time to time, various governmental
agencies have proposed additional regulation of encryption technology.

Our growth strategy includes further expanding our operations and client and
user base in international markets and acquiring companies that may operate
in countries where we do not already do business. Such acquisitions may
subject us to additional or expanded export regulations. Further, any change
in export or import regulations or controls, economic sanctions or related
legislation, or change in the countries, governments, persons, or
technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of
our products by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products
to, existing or potential clients with global operations. Any decreased use
of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products
in major international markets could adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.

Changes in tax laws or tax rulings could adversely affect our effective tax
rates, business, financial condition, and results of operations.

The tax regimes we are subject to or operate under are unsettled and may be
subject to significant change. Changes in tax laws (including in response to
the COVID-19 pandemic) or tax rulings, or changes in interpretations of
existing laws, could cause us to be subject to additional income-based taxes
and non-income taxes (such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, digital tax,
net worth, property, and goods and services taxes), which in turn could
adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. For
example, in December 2017, the U.S. federal government enacted the tax
reform legislation known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the 2017 Tax Act).
The 2017 Tax Act significantly changed the existing U.S. corporate income
tax laws by, among other things, lowering the U.S. corporate tax rate,
implementing a partially territorial tax system, and imposing a one-time
deemed repatriation tax on certain post-1986 foreign earnings. There is
currently significant tax legislation pending before Congress which, among
other tax provisions, repeals and/or modifies key provisions of the 2017 Tax
Act. If passed, this legislation could materially impact our tax
obligations, including by increasing our effective tax rate. In addition,
many countries in the European Union, as well as a number of other countries
and organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development, have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax
laws or have enacted new laws that could impact our tax obligations. Some of
these or other new rules could result in double taxation of our
international earnings. Any significant changes to our future effective tax
rate could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results
of operations.
We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.
Our income tax obligations are based in part on our corporate operating
structure and intercompany arrangements, including the manner in which we
develop, value, manage, and use our intellectual property and the valuation
of our intercompany transactions. The tax laws applicable to our business,
including the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions, are subject
to interpretation and certain jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting
their laws in new ways in an effort to raise additional tax revenue. Our
existing corporate structure and intercompany arrangements have been
implemented in a manner we believe is in compliance with current prevailing
tax laws. However, the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we
operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or
intercompany arrangements, which could impact our worldwide effective tax
rate and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Moreover, changes to our corporate structure and intercompany agreements,
including through acquisitions, could impact our worldwide effective tax
rate and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.

In addition, we are subject to federal, state, and local taxes in the United
States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required
in evaluating our tax positions and our worldwide provision for (benefit
from) taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many
activities and transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is
uncertain. Our tax obligations and effective tax rates could be adversely
affected by changes in the relevant tax, accounting, and other laws,
regulations, principles, and interpretations, including those relating to
income tax nexus, by our earnings being lower than anticipated in
jurisdictions where we have lower
                                     70                                     
Table of contents
statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have
higher statutory rates, by challenges to our intercompany relationships and
transfer pricing arrangements. The relevant taxing authorities may disagree
with our determinations as to the income and expenses attributable to
specific jurisdictions. If such a disagreement were to occur, and our
position were not sustained, we could be required to pay additional taxes,
interest, and penalties, which could result in one-time tax charges, higher
effective tax rates, reduced cash flows and lower overall profitability of
our business, with some changes possibly affecting our tax obligations in
future or past years. We believe that our financial statements reflect
adequate reserves to cover such a contingency, but there can be no
assurances in that regard.

Taxing authorities may successfully assert that we should have collected or
in the future should collect sales and use, value added or similar taxes,
and any such assessments could adversely affect our business, financial
condition, and results of operations.

We do not collect sales and use, value added, and similar taxes in all
jurisdictions in which we have sales, based on our belief that such taxes
are not applicable in certain jurisdictions. Sales and use, value added, and
similar tax laws and rates vary greatly by jurisdiction. Certain
jurisdictions in which we do not collect such taxes may assert that such
taxes are applicable or that our presence in such jurisdictions is
sufficient to require us to collect taxes, which could result in tax
assessments, penalties, and interest, and we may be required to collect such
taxes in the future. Such tax assessments, penalties, and interest or future
requirements may adversely affect our financial condition and results of
operations. Further, in June 2018, the Supreme Court held in South Dakota v.
Wayfair, Inc. that states could impose sales tax collection obligations on
out-of-state sellers even if those sellers lack any physical presence within
the states imposing the sales taxes. Under the Wayfair decision, a person
requires only a “substantial nexus” with the taxing state before the state
may subject the person to sales tax collection obligations therein. An
increasing number of states (both before and after the publication of the
Wayfair decision) have considered or adopted laws that attempt to impose
sales tax collection obligations on out-of-state sellers. The Supreme
Court’s Wayfair decision has removed a significant impediment to the
enactment and enforcement of these laws, and it is possible that states may
seek to tax out-of-state sellers on sales that occurred in prior tax years,
which could create additional administrative burdens for us, put us at a
competitive disadvantage if such states do not impose similar obligations on
our competitors, and decrease our future sales, which could adversely affect
our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

If we are found liable for content that is distributed through or
advertising that is served through our Software Platform or Apps, our
business could be adversely affected.

As a distributor of content, we face potential liability for negligence,
copyright, patent or trademark infringement, public performance royalties,
or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we
distribute. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the DMCA) is intended, in
part, to limit the liability of eligible service providers for caching,
hosting, or linking to user content that includes materials that infringe
copyrights or other rights. We rely on the protections provided by the DMCA
in conducting our business. Similarly, Section 230 of the Communications
Decency Act (Section 230) protects online distribution platforms, such as
ours, from actions taken under various laws that might otherwise impose
liability on the platform provider for what content creators develop or the
actions they take or inspire.

However, the DMCA, Section 230, and similar statutes and doctrines that we
may rely on in the future are subject to uncertain judicial interpretation
and regulatory and legislative amendments. Future regulatory or legislative
changes may ultimately require us to take a more active approach towards
content moderation, which could diminish the depth, breadth, and variety of
content we offer and, in so doing, reduce our revenue. Moreover, the DMCA
and Section 230 provide protections primarily in the United States. If the
rules around these statutes and doctrines change, if international
jurisdictions refuse to apply similar protections, or if a court were to
disagree with our application of those rules to our business, we could incur
liability and our business could be adversely affected. If we become liable
for these types of claims as a result of the content that is included in our
Apps or the advertisements that are served through our Software Platform,
then our business may be adversely affected. Litigation to defend these
claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any
liability could adversely affect our business. Our insurance may not be
adequate to cover these types of claims or any liability that may be imposed
on us.

In addition, regardless of any legal protections that may limit our
liability for the actions of third parties, we may incur significant legal
expenses and other costs if copyright holders assert claims, or commence
litigation, alleging copyright infringement against our third-party
developers. While we prohibit mobile apps without distribution rights from
the copyright holder, and we maintain processes and systems for the
reporting and removal of infringing mobile apps, such prohibitions,
processes, and systems may not always be successful. If other developers,
                                     71                                     
Table of contents
licensees, platform providers, business partners, and personnel are
influenced by the existence of types of claims or proceedings and are
deterred from working with us as a consequence, our ability to maintain or
expand our business, including through international expansion plans, could
be adversely affected.

We will incur increased costs and demands upon management as a result of
complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies, which
could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.

We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-
Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank
Act), and the rules and regulations of the SEC and the Nasdaq listing
standards. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file
annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and
results of operations. Compliance with these requirements has increased and
will continue to increase our legal, accounting, and financial compliance
costs and increase demand on our systems, making some activities more time-
consuming and costly. We expect these rules and regulations to make it more
expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we
may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur
substantially higher costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. As a
result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified
individuals to serve on our board of directors or as our executive officers.
As a public company, we expect to incur significant expenses and devote
substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with the auditor
attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In that
regard, we will need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with
appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge. In
addition, as a public company, we may be subject to shareholder activism,
which can lead to substantial costs, distract management, and impact the
manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently
anticipate.

As a result of disclosure of information in our public filings with the SEC
as required of a public company, our business and financial condition will
become more visible, which we believe may result in threatened or actual
litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If such claims
are successful, our business, financial condition, and results of operations
could be adversely affected, and even if the claims do not result in
litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and
resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our
management and our board of directors and adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.

Legal or regulatory proceedings and settlements could cause us to incur
additional expenses or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial
condition, and results of operations.

We are involved in or may become involved in claims, suits, government
investigations, including formal and informal inquiries from government
authorities and regulators, and proceedings arising in the ordinary course
of our business, including actions with respect to intellectual property
claims, securities claims, privacy, data protection, or law enforcement
matters, tax matters, labor and employment claims, commercial and
acquisition-related claims, and other matters. We may become the subject of
investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests for information, actions,
and audits in the United States, Europe, and around the world, particularly
in the areas of privacy, data protection, law enforcement, consumer
protection, and competition, as we continue to grow and expand our
operations. In addition, we are currently, and may in the future be, subject
to regulatory orders or consent decrees. For example, data protection,
competition, and consumer protection authorities in the European Union have
initiated actions, investigations, or administrative orders seeking to
restrict the ways in which we collect and use information, or impose
sanctions, and other authorities may do the same.

Any such claims, suits, government investigations, and proceedings are
inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty.
Regardless of their outcomes, such legal or regulatory proceedings can have
an adverse impact on us because of legal costs, diversion of management and
other personnel attention, and other factors. In addition, it is possible
that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in
substantial costs, civil and criminal liability, penalties, or sanctions, as
well as judgments, consent decrees, or orders preventing us from offering
certain features, functionalities, products or services, or requiring a
change in our business practices, products or technologies, which could
adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, and results
of operations.

Many of our products and services contain open source software, and we
license some of our software through open source projects, which may pose
particular risks to our proprietary software, products, and
                                     72                                     
Table of contents
services in a manner that could adversely affect our business, financial
condition, and results of operations.

We use open source software in our Core Technologies, Software Platform, and
Apps and expect to continue to use open source software in the future. In
addition, we contribute software source code to open source projects under
open source licenses or release internal software projects under open source
licenses, and anticipate continuing to do so in the future. The terms of
many open source licenses to which we are subject have not been interpreted
by U.S. or foreign courts, and there is a risk that open source software
licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated
conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide or distribute our
products or services. Additionally, under some open source licenses, if we
combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain
manner, third parties may claim ownership of, a license to, or demand
release of, the open source software or derivative works that we developed
using such software, which could include our proprietary source code. Such
third parties may also seek to enforce the terms of the applicable open
source license through litigation which, if successful, could require us to
make our proprietary software source code freely available, purchase a
costly license, or cease offering the implicated products or services unless
and until we can re-engineer them to avoid infringement. This re-engineering
process could require significant additional research and development
resources, and we may not be able to complete it successfully. In addition
to risks related to open source license requirements, use of certain open
source software may pose greater risks than use of third-party commercial
software, since open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or
controls on the origin of software. Any of these risks could be difficult to
eliminate or manage, and, if not addressed, could adversely affect our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Our ability to acquire and maintain licenses to intellectual property may
affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Competition for these licenses may make them more expensive and increase our
costs.

While most of the intellectual property we use in our Core Technologies,
Software Platform, and Apps is created by us, from time to time, we also
acquire rights to third-party intellectual property. Proprietary licenses
may limit our use of intellectual property to specific uses and for specific
time periods, require time and attention of licensors in providing guidance
and related approvals, and include other contractual obligations with which
we must comply. Additionally, competition for these licenses is intense and
often results in increased advances, minimum payment guarantees, and
royalties to the licensor, and as such we may be unable to identify suitable
licensing targets or complete licensing arrangements. If we are unable to
obtain and remain in compliance with the terms of these licenses or obtain
additional licenses on reasonable economic terms, our business and results
of operations could be adversely affected. Further, if the mix of IAPs
shifts toward mobile games in which we use licensed intellectual property or
if we develop additional Apps that require licensing of third-party
intellectual property, our overall margins may be reduced due to royalty
obligations.

In addition, many of our Apps are built on proprietary source code of third
parties, such as Unity Software. Unity Software offers certain solutions
that may compete with our offerings. If we are unable to renew licenses to
proprietary source code underlying our mobile games, or the terms and
conditions of these licenses change at the time of renewal, our business,
financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.
We rely on third parties, including Unity Software, to maintain versions of
their proprietary engines that allow us to distribute our mobile games on
multiple platforms. If a third party from whom we license source code
discontinues support for one or more of these platforms, our business,
financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Failure to protect or enforce our proprietary and intellectual property
rights or the costs involved in such enforcement could adversely affect our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We regard our Core Technologies, Software Platform, and Apps and related
source code as proprietary and rely on a variety of methods, including a
combination of copyright, patent, trademark, and trade secret laws and
employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements, to protect our
proprietary rights. We view the protection of our trade secrets, copyrights,
trademarks, service marks, trade dress, domain names, patents, and other
product rights as critical to our success. We strive to protect our
intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state, and common law
rights, as well as contractual restrictions and business practices. We also
enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our
employees and contractors and confidentiality agreements with parties with
whom we conduct business in order to limit access to, and disclosure and use
of, our proprietary information. However, these contractual arrangements and
business practices may not prevent the misappropriation of our proprietary
information or deter independent development of similar technologies by
others.

We own or license, and pursue the registration of, copyrights, trademarks,
service marks, domain names, and patents in the United States and in certain
locations outside the United States. This process can be expensive and
                                     73                                     
Table of contents
time-consuming, may not always be successful depending on local laws or
other circumstances, and we also may choose not to pursue registrations in
every location depending on the nature of the project to which the
intellectual property rights pertain. We may, over time, increase our
investments in protecting our creative works.

We are aware that some unauthorized copying of our Apps occurs, and if a
significantly greater amount of unauthorized copying of our Apps were to
occur, it could adversely affect our business. In addition, even if
authorized copying of our Apps occurs, third-party platforms may not remove
infringing material. We also cannot be certain that existing intellectual
property laws will provide adequate protection for our products in
connection with emerging technologies. Litigation may be necessary to
enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets, or
determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others.
Any litigation of this nature, regardless of outcome or merit, could result
in substantial costs, adverse publicity, and diversion of management and
technical resources. If we fail to maintain, protect, and enhance our
intellectual property rights, our business, financial condition, and results
of operations could be adversely affected.

We are, and may in the future be, subject to intellectual property disputes,
which are costly to defend and could require us to pay significant damages
and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future.

From time to time, we have faced, and we may face in the future, allegations
that we have infringed the trademarks, copyrights, patents, and other
intellectual property rights of third parties, including from our
competitors, non-practicing entities and former employers of our personnel.
Intellectual property litigation may be protracted and expensive, and the
results are difficult to predict. As the result of any court judgment or
settlement, we may be obligated to alter our Software Platform or Apps, in a
particular geographic region or worldwide, pay royalties or significant
settlement costs, purchase licenses, or develop substitutes.

In certain of our agreements we also indemnify our licensees and other
business partners. We may incur significant expenses defending these
business partners if they are sued for intellectual property infringement
based on allegations related to our technology. If a business partner were
to lose a lawsuit and in turn seek indemnification from us, we also could be
subject to significant monetary liabilities. In addition, because our Core
Technologies, Software Platform, and Apps often involve the use of third-
party technology, this increases our exposure to litigation in circumstances
where there is a claim of infringement asserted against one of our mobile
games or other products and services in question, even if the claim does not
pertain to our technology.
                                                                            
   Risks Related to Financial and Accounting Matters                        
                                                                            
If we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and
internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and
accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be
impaired.

As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the
Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the rules and regulations of the
applicable Nasdaq listing standards. We expect that the requirements of
these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting,
and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-
consuming and costly, and place significant strain on our personnel,
systems, and resources.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain
effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure
controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we will file with the SEC
is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods
specified in SEC rules and forms and that information required to be
disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to our principal executive and financial officers. We are also continuing to
improve our internal control over financial reporting, which includes hiring
additional accounting and financial personnel to implement such processes
and controls.

In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we
have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant
resources, including accounting-related costs and significant management
oversight. If any of these new or improved controls and systems do not
perform as expected, we may experience further deficiencies in our controls.

Our current controls and any new controls that we develop may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. Further, to the
extent we acquire other businesses, the acquired company may not have a
sufficiently robust system of controls and we may discover deficiencies. Any
failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties
encountered in their implementation or improvement could adversely affect
our
                                     74                                     
Table of contents
results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations
and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior
periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control
over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of periodic
management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting
firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting that we will eventually be required to include in
our periodic reports that will be filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure
controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could
also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other
information, which would likely cause the market price of our Class A common
stock to decline. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these
requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the Nasdaq Global
Select Market. Prior to our IPO, we were not required to comply with the SEC
rules that implement Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and were
therefore not required to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of
our internal control over financial reporting for that purpose. As a public
company, we are required to provide an annual management report on the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting commencing
with our second annual report on Form 10-K.

Our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to
formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting commencing with our second annual report on Form 10-K. At such
time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report
that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our
internal control over financial reporting is documented, designed, or
operating. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and
internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect our
business, financial condition, and results of operations and could cause the
market price of our Class A common stock to decline.

Our results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in
financial accounting standards or by the application of existing or future
accounting standards to our business as it evolves.

Our reported results of operations are impacted by the accounting standards
promulgated by the SEC and accounting standards bodies and the methods,
estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies. A
change in accounting standards could have a significant effect on our
reported financial results, and may even affect the reporting of
transactions completed before the announcement or effectiveness of a change.
The frequency of accounting standards changes could accelerate, including
conversion to unified international accounting standards. Accounting
standards affecting revenue recognition have affected, and could further
significantly affect, the way we account for revenue. Any future changes to
accounting standards may cause our results of operations to fluctuate. For
example, if the accounting standards for revenue derived from free-to-play
mobile games were to change, particularly with respect to revenue generated
from digital storefronts, our results of operations could be adversely
affected.

Further, although we believe our estimates are reasonable based on available
user information, we may revise such estimates in the future in the event
our users’ average playing period changes. Any adjustments arising from
changes in the estimates of the lives of these virtual goods would be
applied to the current quarter and prospectively on the basis that such
changes are caused by new information indicating a change in the user
behavior patterns of our users. As we enhance, expand and diversify our
business and product offerings, the application of existing or future
financial accounting standards could adversely our results of operations.

We rely on assumptions and estimates to calculate certain of our key metrics
and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics could adversely affect
our reputation and our business.

Certain of the metrics that we disclose are calculated using internal
company data that has not been independently verified or data from third-
party attribution partners. While these metrics and figures are based on
what we believe to be reasonable calculations for the applicable period of
measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring these metrics and
figures across our worldwide client base and user base. We regularly review
and may adjust our processes for calculating our metrics and other figures
to improve their accuracy, but these efforts may not prove successful and we
may discover material inaccuracies. In addition, our methodology for
calculating these metrics may differ from the methodology used by other
companies to calculate similar metrics and figures. We may also discover
unexpected errors in the data that we are using that resulted from technical
or other errors. If we determine that any of our metrics or figures are not
accurate, we may be required to revise or cease reporting such metrics or
figures. Any real or perceived inaccuracies in our metrics and other figures
could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business.

Conversion of key internal systems and processes, particularly our
enterprise resource planning system, and problems with the design,
implementation, or operation of these systems and processes could interfere
with, and therefore adversely affect, our business and operations.
                                     75

We converted certain key internal business systems and processes, including
our enterprise resource planning system, to a cloud-based system. We have
invested, and will continue to invest, significant capital and human
resources in the design, implementation, and operation of these business
systems and processes. Any problems in the functioning of these systems or
processes, particularly any that impact our operations, could adversely
affect our ability to process payments, record and transfer information in a
timely and accurate manner, recognize revenue, file SEC reports in a timely
manner, or otherwise run our business and could adversely affect our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our
goodwill becomes impaired.

We are required under GAAP to review our goodwill for impairment at least
annually or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate
the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that may be considered a
change in circumstances, indicating a requirement to reevaluate whether our
goodwill continues to be recoverable, include a significant decline in the
market price of our Class A common stock and our market capitalization,
slower growth rates in our industry, or other materially adverse events. We
may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial
statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill is
determined.

We have substantial indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities
and our obligations thereunder may limit our operational flexibility or
otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.

We are party to a credit agreement that provides for senior secured credit
consisting of term loans and a revolving credit facility, which are
scheduled to mature in 2025. As of September 30, 2021, the aggregate
principal amount of our outstanding indebtedness under our credit facilities
was $1.78 billion, consisting of term loans. In October 2021, we amended our
credit facility and issued an additional $1.5 billion of term loans. There
can be no assurance that we will be able to repay this indebtedness when
due, or that we will be able to refinance this indebtedness on acceptable
terms or at all.

Our indebtedness could adversely impact us. For example, these obligations
could among other things:

• make it difficult for us to pay other obligations;

• increase our cost of borrowing;

• make it difficult to obtain favorable terms for any necessary future
financing for working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions
and partnerships, debt service requirements, or other purposes;

• restrict us from making strategic acquisitions and partnerships or cause
us to make divestitures or similar transactions;

• adversely affect our liquidity and result in a material adverse effect on
our financial condition upon repayment of the indebtedness;

• require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from
operations to service and repay the indebtedness, reducing the amount of
cash flow available for other purposes;

• increase our vulnerability to adverse and economic conditions;

• increase our exposure to interest rate risk from variable rate
indebtedness;

• place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged
competitors; and

• limit our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our
business.

In addition, from time to time we have entered into interest rate swap
instruments to limit our exposure to changes in variable interest rates.
While our hedging strategy is designed to minimize the impact of increases
in interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt, including our credit
facility, there can be no guarantee that our hedging strategy will be
effective, and we may experience credit-related losses in some
circumstances.

Our credit agreement also imposes restrictions on us and requires us to
maintain compliance with specified covenants. Our ability to comply with
these covenants may be affected by market, economic, financial, competitive,
legislative, and regulatory factors, as well as other factors that are
beyond our control. A breach of any of the covenants in the credit agreement
governing our credit facilities could result in an event of default, which,
if not cured or waived, could trigger acceleration of our indebtedness and
an increase in the interest rates applicable to such indebtedness, and may
result in the acceleration of or default under any other debt we may incur
in the future to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision
applies. In addition, we have granted a security interest in a
                                     76

significant portion of our assets to secure our obligations under our credit
facility. During the existence of an event of default under our credit
agreement, the applicable lenders could exercise their rights and remedies
thereunder, including by way of initiating foreclosure proceedings against
any assets constituting collateral for our obligations under the credit
facility. The acceleration of the indebtedness under our credit agreement or
under any other indebtedness could have a material and adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our significant
debt service obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt
obligations depends on our financial condition and results of operations,
which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to
certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory, and other factors
beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows
from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal,
premium, if any, or interest on our indebtedness. If our cash flows and
capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we
may be forced to reduce or delay strategic acquisitions and partnerships,
capital expenditures, and payments on account of other obligations, seek
additional capital, restructure or refinance our indebtedness, or sell
assets. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit
us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our ability to
restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the
capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of
our debt could be at higher interest rates and could require us to comply
with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business
operations. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to
refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at
all.

If we are unable to repay or otherwise refinance our indebtedness when due,
or if any other event of default is not cured or waived, the applicable
lenders could accelerate our outstanding obligations or proceed against the
collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness, which could force us
into bankruptcy or liquidation. In the event the applicable lenders
accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not
have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. Any acceleration of
amounts due under the agreements governing our credit facility or the
exercise by the applicable lenders of their rights under the security
documents could have a material and adverse effect on our business.

We may require additional capital to meet our financial obligations and
support business growth, and this capital may not be available on acceptable
terms or at all.

We intend to continue to make significant investments to support our
business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business
challenges, including the need to develop our Software Platform and Software
Platform, enhance our existing Apps and develop new Apps and features,
improve our operating infrastructure, or enter into strategic acquisitions
and partnerships. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity, equity-
linked, or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise
additional funds through future issuances of equity or convertible debt
securities, our existing stockholders could experience significant dilution,
and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and
privileges superior to those of holders of our Class A common stock. Any
debt financing that we secure in the future could involve offering
additional security interests and undertaking restrictive covenants relating
to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational
matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional
capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential
acquisitions. Our credit agreement, which provides for a term loan and
revolving credit facility, contains financial covenants with which we must
comply. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable
to us, if at all. Additionally, if we seek to access additional capital or
increase our borrowing, there can be no assurance that financing and credit
may be available on favorable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain
adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require
it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to
business challenges could be significantly impaired, and our business,
financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely affected.

The London Interbank Offered Rate calculation method may change and LIBOR is
expected to be phased out after 2021.

Interest on our term loan and revolving credit facility, which are scheduled
to mature in 2025, may be calculated based on the London Interbank Offered
Rate (LIBOR). On July 27, 2017, the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (the
authority that administers LIBOR) announced that it intends to phase out
LIBOR by the end of 2021. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating
LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021, or if
alternative rates or benchmarks will be adopted. Changes in the method of
calculating LIBOR, or the
                                     77                                     
Table of contents
replacement of LIBOR with an alternative rate or benchmark, may adversely
affect interest rates and result in higher borrowing costs. This could
materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and
liquidity. We cannot predict the effect of the potential changes to LIBOR or
the establishment and use of alternative rates or benchmarks. We may need to
renegotiate our credit facility or incur other indebtedness, and changes in
the method of calculating LIBOR, or the use of an alternative rate or
benchmark, may negatively impact the terms of such renegotiated credit
facility or such other indebtedness. If changes are made to the method of
calculating LIBOR or LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to amend certain
contracts and cannot predict what alternative rate or benchmark would be
negotiated. This may result in an increase to our interest expense.
Risks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock and Governance
The multi-class structure of our common stock and the Voting Agreement among
the Class B Stockholders have the effect of concentrating voting power with
the Class B Stockholders, which will limit your ability to influence the
outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the
election of our board of directors, the adoption of amendments to our
certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and the approval of any merger,
consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other
major corporate transaction.

We have three classes of common stock. Our Class A common stock has one vote
per share, our Class B common stock has 20 votes per share, and our Class C
common stock has no voting rights, except as otherwise required by law. Adam
Foroughi, our co-founder, CEO, and Chairperson; Herald Chen, our President
and Chief Financial Officer, and a member of our board of directors; and KKR
Denali (collectively with certain affiliates, the Class B Stockholders)
together hold all of the issued and outstanding shares of our Class B common
stock. As of September 30, 2021, the Class B Stockholders collectively held
approximately 93% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock in
the aggregate. This voting power includes shares of Class A common stock
deemed beneficially owned in accordance with Rule 13d-3(d)(1) under the
Exchange Act. The Class B Stockholders have entered into a voting agreement
(the Voting Agreement) whereby all Class B common stock held by the Class B
Stockholders and their respective permitted entities and permitted
transferees will be voted as determined by two of Mr. Foroughi, Mr. Chen,
and KKR Denali (one of which must be Mr. Foroughi). As a result, the Class B
Stockholders, in particular, Mr. Foroughi, Mr. Chen, and KKR Denali, will be
able to determine or significantly influence any action requiring the
approval of our stockholders, including the election of our board of
directors, the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation
and bylaws, and the approval of any merger, consolidation, sale of all or
substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction. The
Class B Stockholders may have interests that differ from yours and may vote
in a way with which you disagree, and which may be adverse to your
interests. This concentrated control may have the effect of delaying,
preventing, or deterring a change in control of our company, could deprive
our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their capital
stock as part of a sale of our company, and might ultimately affect the
market price of our Class A common stock.

Future transfers by the holders of Class B common stock will generally
result in those shares automatically converting into shares of Class A
common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers
effected for estate planning, transfers among KKR affiliates, or other
transfers among the Class B Stockholders. In addition, each share of Class B
common stock will convert automatically into one share of Class A common
stock upon certain events specified in our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation.

In addition, because our Class C common stock carries no voting rights
(except as otherwise required by law), if we issue Class C common stock in
the future, the holders of Class B common stock may be able to elect all of
our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a
vote of our stockholders for a longer period of time than would be the case
if we issued Class A common stock rather than Class C common stock in such
transactions.

We are considered a “controlled company” within the meaning of the Nasdaq
corporate governance requirements, and, as a result, we qualify for, and
intend to rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance
requirements.

As a result of our multi-class common stock structure and the Voting
Agreement among the Class B Stockholders, the Class B Stockholders
collectively hold greater than a majority of the voting power of our
outstanding capital stock and the Class B Stockholders have the authority to
vote the shares of all Class B common stock, subject to the terms of the
Voting Agreement, at their discretion on all matters to be voted upon by
stockholders. Therefore, we are considered a “controlled company” as that
term is set forth in the Nasdaq corporate governance requirements. Under
these corporate governance requirements, a company in which over 50% of the
                                     78                                     
Table of contents
voting power for the election of directors is held by an individual, a
group, or another company is a “controlled company” and may elect not to
comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including:

• the requirement that a majority of its board of directors consist of
independent directors;

• the requirement that we have a nominating/corporate governance committee
that is comprised entirely of independent directors with a written charter
addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities;

• the requirement that we have a compensation committee that is comprised
entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the
committee’s purpose and responsibilities; and

• the requirement for an annual performance evaluation of the nominating and
corporate governance and compensation committees.

We currently utilize, and intend to continue to utilize, certain of these
exemptions. As a result, we do not have a majority of independent directors
and our compensation committee does not consist entirely of independent
directors. Accordingly, you will not have the same protections afforded to
stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate
governance requirements. In the event that we cease to be a “controlled
company” and our Class A common stock continues to be listed on Nasdaq, we
will be required to comply with these provisions within the applicable
transaction periods.
We cannot predict the effect our multi-class structure may have on the
market price of our Class A common stock.
We cannot predict whether our multi-class structure will result in a lower
or more volatile market price of our Class A common stock, in adverse
publicity, or other adverse consequences. For example, certain index
providers have announced restrictions on including companies with multi-
class share structures in certain of their indices. In July 2017, FTSE
Russell announced that it plans to require new constituents of its indices
to have greater than 5% of the company’s voting rights in the hands of
public stockholders, and S&P Dow Jones announced that it will no longer
admit companies with multi-class share structures to certain of its indices.
Affected indices include the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400,
and S&P SmallCap 600, which together make up the S&P Composite 1500. Also in
2017, MSCI, a leading stock index provider, opened public consultations on
their treatment of no-vote and multi-class structures and temporarily barred
new multi-class listings from certain of its indices and in October 2018,
MSCI announced its decision to include equity securities “with unequal
voting structures” in its indices and to launch a new index that
specifically includes voting rights in its eligibility criteria. Under such
announced policies, the multi-class structure of our common stock would make
us ineligible for inclusion in certain indices and, as a result, mutual
funds, exchange-traded funds, and other investment vehicles that attempt to
track those indices would not invest in our Class A common stock. These
policies are relatively new and it is unclear what effect, if any, they will
have on the valuations of publicly-traded companies excluded from such
indices, but it is possible that they may depress valuations, as compared to
similar companies that are included. Given the sustained flow of investment
funds into passive strategies that seek to track certain indices, exclusion
from certain stock indices would likely preclude investment by many of these
funds and could make our Class A common stock less attractive to other
investors. As a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could
be adversely affected.

The market price of our Class A common stock could be volatile, and you
could lose all or part of your investment.

The market price of our Class A common stock may fluctuate substantially
depending on a number of factors, including those described in this “Risk
Factors” section, many of which are beyond our control and may not be
related to our operating performance. These fluctuations could cause you to
lose all or part of your investment in our Class A common stock. Factors
that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our Class A common
stock include the following:

• price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to
time, including fluctuations due to general economic uncertainty or negative
market sentiment, in particular related to the COVID-19 pandemic;

• volatility in the market and trading volumes of technology stocks;

• changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other
technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular;

• sales of shares of our Class A common stock by us or our stockholders;
                                     79                                     
Table of contents
• rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our
industry;

• failure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in
financial estimates by securities analysts who follow our company, or our
failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;

• actual or perceived significant data breaches involving our Software
Platform or Apps;

• the financial or non-financial metric projections we may provide to the
public, any changes in those projections or our failure to meet those
projections;

• third-party data published about us or other mobile gaming companies,
whether or not such data accurately reflects actual levels of usage;

• announcements by us or our competitors of new products or services;

• the public’s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements,
and filings with the SEC;

• fluctuations in the trading volume of shares of our Class A common stock
or the size of our public float;

• short selling of our Class A common stock or related derivative
securities;

• actual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our results of
operations;

• actual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors’
businesses, or the competitive landscape generally;

• our issuance of shares of our Class A common stock;

• litigation or regulatory action involving us, our industry or both, or
investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our
competitors;

• developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other
proprietary rights;

• announced or completed acquisitions of businesses or technologies by us or
our competitors;

• new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or
regulations applicable to our business;

• changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or
principles;

• major catastrophic events in our domestic and foreign markets;

• any significant change in our management; and

• general economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets.

In addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in
general experiences a loss of investor confidence, the market price of our
Class A common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business,
financial condition, or results of operations. The market price of our Class
A common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other
companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us.
Accordingly, we cannot assure you of the liquidity of any trading market,
your ability to sell your shares of our Class A common stock when desired,
or the prices that you may obtain for your shares of our Class A common
stock.

In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a
company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been
brought against that company. If the market price of our Class A common
stock is volatile, we may become the target of securities litigation.
Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our
management’s attention and resources from our business. Such litigation
could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.

Because we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock
in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole
source of gain.

You should not rely on an investment in our Class A common stock to provide
dividend income. We do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the
foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain future earnings, if any,
to fund the development and growth of our business. In addition, our credit
agreement contains, and any future credit facility or financing we obtain
may contain, terms limiting the amount of dividends that may be declared or
paid on our Class A common stock. Any future determination to pay dividends
will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent
upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements,
and
                                     80

applicable contractual restrictions. As a result, stockholders should rely
on sales of their Class A common stock after price appreciation as the only
way to realize any future gains on their investment.

The issuance of additional stock in connection with financings,
acquisitions, investments, our equity incentive plans, or otherwise will
dilute all other stockholders.

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue
up to 1,500,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, up to 150,000,000 shares
of Class C common stock, and up to 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock
with such rights and preferences as may be determined by our board of
directors. Subject to compliance with applicable rules and regulations, we
may issue shares of Class A common stock or securities convertible into
shares of our Class A common stock from time to time in connection with a
financing, acquisition, investment, our equity incentive plans, or
otherwise. For example, in connection with our acquisition of Adjust in
April 2021, we issued convertible securities that converted into an
aggregate of 6,320,688 shares of our Class A common stock. Any such issuance
could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause
the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.

Our multi-class stock structure, the Voting Agreement, and other provisions
in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and
restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest
difficult, thereby depressing the market price of our Class A common stock.

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and
restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our
company more difficult, including the following:

• our multi-class common stock structure and the Voting Agreement, which
provide the Class B Stockholders with the ability to determine or
significantly influence the outcome of matters requiring stockholder
approval, even if they own significantly less than a majority of the shares
of our outstanding common stock;

• vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by our board of
directors and not by stockholders;

• a special meeting of our stockholders may only be called by a majority of
our board of directors, the chairperson of our board of directors, our Chief
Executive Officer, or our President;

• advance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates
for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of
stockholders;

• our amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not provide for
cumulative voting;

• our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes
undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and
shares of which may be issued by our board of directors, without further
action by our stockholders;

• after the first date on which the outstanding shares of our Class B common
stock represent less than a majority of the total combined voting power of
our Class A common stock and our Class B common stock (the Voting Threshold
Date), our stockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of
stockholders and will not be able to take action by written consent for any
matter; and

• certain litigation against us may only be brought in Delaware.

These provisions, alone or together, could discourage, delay, or prevent a
transaction involving a change in control of our company. These provisions
could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for
stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take
other corporate actions they desire, any of which, under certain
circumstances, could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a
premium for their shares of our Class A common stock, and could also affect
the market price of our Class A common stock.

Our amended and restated bylaws designate a state or federal court located
within the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United
States as the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and
our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to choose the
judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or
employees.

Our amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing
to the selection of an alternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or
proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of
breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, or other
employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action arising pursuant to
any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and
restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws,
or (iv) any other action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal
affairs doctrine shall be
                                     81                                     
Table of contents
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery
does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of
Delaware), in all cases subject to the court having jurisdiction over
indispensable parties named as defendants, and provided that this exclusive
forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or
duty created by the Exchange Act.

Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal
and state courts over all such Securities Act actions. Accordingly, both
state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. To
prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat
of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different courts, among other
considerations, our amended and restated bylaws also provide that the
federal district courts of the United States of America will be the
exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action
arising under the Securities Act. However, while the Delaware Supreme Court
ruled in March 2020 that federal forum selection provisions purporting to
require claims under the Securities Act be brought in federal court are
“facially valid” under Delaware law, there is uncertainty as to whether
other courts will enforce our federal forum provision. If the federal forum
provision is found to be unenforceable, we may incur additional costs
associated with resolving such matters.

Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding or owning
(or continuing to hold or own) any interest in any of our securities shall
be deemed to have notice of and consented to the foregoing bylaw provisions.
Although we believe these exclusive forum provisions benefit us by providing
increased consistency in the application of Delaware law and federal
securities laws in the types of lawsuits to which each applies, the
exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a
claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or any of our
directors, officers, stockholders, or other employees, which may discourage
lawsuits with respect to such claims against us and our current and former
directors, officers, stockholders, or other employees. Our stockholders will
not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws
and the rules and regulations thereunder as a result of our exclusive forum
provisions. Further, in the event a court finds either exclusive forum
provision contained in our amended and restated bylaws to be unenforceable
or inapplicable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with
resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our results
of operations.

During the three months ended September 30, 2021, we issued 405,205 shares
of our Class A common stock upon the partial conversion of a convertible
security that had been issued in connection with an acquisition.

During the three months ended September 30, 2021, we issued RSUs covering
359,623 shares of our Class A common stock under our 2021 Partner Studio
Incentive Plan.

The foregoing transactions did not involve any underwriters, any
underwriting discounts or commissions, or any public offering. We believe
the offer, sale, and issuance of the above securities was exempt from
registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”) by
virtue of Section 4(a)(2) of the Act and Regulation S promulgated under the
Act, because the issuance of securities to the recipients did not involve a
public offering. The recipients of the securities in the transaction
represented their intentions to acquire the securities for investment only
and not with a view to or for sale in connection with any distribution
thereof, and appropriate legends were placed upon the stock certificates
issued in the transaction. All recipients had adequate access, through their
relationships with us or otherwise, to information about us. The issuance of
these securities was made without any general solicitation or advertising.

On April 19, 2021, we completed our initial public offering (IPO), in which
we sold 22,500,000 shares of our Class A common stock and KKR Denali
Holdings L.P. sold 2,500,000 shares of Class A common stock at a price to
the public of $80.00 per share. We received aggregate net proceeds of $1.75
billion, net of underwriting discounts and commissions of $47.2 million and
offering expenses of $7.9 million subject to certain cost reimbursements.

We utilized approximately $400.0 million of the net proceeds from our IPO to
repay the entire outstanding amount under our revolving credit facility. We
intend to use the net proceeds we received from our IPO for general
corporate purposes, including working capital, operating expenses and
capital expenditures. Additionally, we may use a portion of the net proceeds
we received from our IPO to enter into strategic acquisitions and
partnerships. The representatives of the underwriters of our IPO were Morgan
Stanley & Co. LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC. No payments were made by
us to directors, officers or persons owning ten percent or more of our
common

There has been no material change in the planned use of the IPO proceeds as
described in our final prospectus filed with the SEC on April 15, 2021,
pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the Securities Act.
