This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements
within the meaning of the federal securities laws, which statements involve
substantial risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements generally
relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In
some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain
words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,”
“could,” “intend,” “target,” “project,” “contemplate,” “believe,”
“estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue” or the negative of these
words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations,
strategy, plans, or intentions. Forward-looking statements contained in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include statements about:

• our future financial performance, including our expectations regarding our
revenue, cost of revenue, and operating expenses, and our ability to achieve
or maintain future profitability;

• the sufficiency of our cash and cash equivalents to meet our liquidity
needs;

• the demand for our AppLovin Software Platform and AppLovin Apps;

• our ability to attract and retain business clients and users;

• our ability to develop new products, features, and enhancements for our
AppLovin Core Technologies and AppLovin Software Platform and to launch or
acquire new AppLovin Apps and successfully monetize them;

• our ability to compete with existing and new competitors in existing and
new markets and offerings;

• our ability to successfully acquire and integrate companies and assets and
to expand and diversify our operations through strategic acquisitions and
partnerships;

• our strategic review of our AppLovin Apps portfolio;

• our ability to maintain the security and availability of our AppLovin Core
Technologies, AppLovin Software Platform, and AppLovin Apps;

• our expectations regarding the effects of existing and developing laws and
regulations, including with respect to taxation and privacy and data
protection;

• our ability to manage risk associated with our business;

• our expectations regarding new and evolving markets;

• our ability to develop and protect our brand;

• our expectations and management of future growth;

and

• the increased expenses associated with being a public company.

We caution you that the foregoing list may not contain all of the forward-
looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future
events. We have based the forward-looking statements contained in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q primarily on our current expectations and
projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our
business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. The
outcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is
subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors, including those
described in the section titled “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive
and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from
time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all risks and
uncertainties that could have an impact on the forward-looking statements
contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We cannot assure you that
the results, events, and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking
                                     1                                      
Table of contents
statements will be achieved or occur, and actual results, events, or
circumstances could differ materially from those described in the forward-
looking statements.

Neither we nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and
completeness of any of these forward-looking statements. Moreover, the
forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q relate
only to events as of the date on which the statements are made. We undertake
no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to reflect events or circumstances after the
date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or to reflect new information or
the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law. We may
not actually achieve the plans, intentions, or expectations disclosed in our
forward-looking statements and you should not place undue reliance on our
forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements do not reflect
the potential impact of any future acquisitions, partnerships, mergers,
dispositions, joint ventures, or investments we may make.

In addition, statements that “we believe” and similar statements reflect our
beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These statements are based
upon information available to us as of the date of this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q, and while we believe such information forms a reasonable basis
for such statements, such information may be limited or incomplete, and our
statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an
exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant

   1. Description of Business Basis of Presentation                         
                                                                            
Description of Business
AppLovin Corporation (the “Company” or “AppLovin” or "we") was incorporated
in the state of Delaware on July 18, 2011. The Company is a leader in the
mobile app industry with a focus on building a software-based platform for
mobile app developers to improve the marketing and monetization of their
apps. The Company also has a globally diversified portfolio of apps—free-to-
play mobile games that it operates through its own or partner studios.

The Company is headquartered in Palo Alto, California, and has several
operating locations in the U.S. as well as various international office
locations in North America, South America, Asia and Europe.
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have
been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles (“GAAP”) and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for interim financial reporting. Certain
information and footnote disclosures normally included in the financial
statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted
pursuant to such rules and regulations. Therefore, the unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in the
Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 11, 2022.
The condensed consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2021 was
derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date but
does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. The accompanying
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all normal and
recurring adjustments, that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for
the fair presentation of the Company’s financial position, results of
operations, cash flows and stockholders’ equity for the interim periods
presented. The results of operations for the three months ended March 31,
2022 shown in this report are not necessarily indicative of the results to
be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2022 or any other period.
                                                                            
  2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies                             
                                                                            
Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
conformity with GAAP. Consolidated financial statements include accounts and
operations of the Company and its subsidiaries in which the Company has a
controlling financial interest. In accordance with the provisions of
Accounting Standards Codifications ("ASC") 810, the Company consolidates any
variable interest entities ("VIE") where it is the primary beneficiary. The
Company engages in business relationships with certain entities in the
ordinary course of business to develop game Apps. The typical condition for
a controlling financial interest ownership is holding a majority of the
voting interests of an entity; however, a controlling financial interest may
also exist in entities, such as VIEs, through arrangements that do not
involve controlling voting interests. ASC 810 requires a variable interest
holder to consolidate a VIE if that party has the power to direct the
activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic
performance and has the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could
potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from
the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We do not
consolidate a VIE in which we have a majority ownership interest when we are
not considered the primary beneficiary. The Company evaluates its
relationships with all VIEs on an ongoing basis. All intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
The Company generates Software Platform and Apps revenue. Software Platform
revenue is generated from fees paid by advertisers who use our Software
Platform. The Company generates Apps revenue from both consumers and
business clients. Consumer revenue is generated from in-app purchases
(“IAPs”) made by users within the Company’s apps (“Apps”). Business revenue
is generated from advertisers that purchase ad inventory from Apps.

Table of contents

Software Platform Revenue
The Software Platform provides the technology to match advertisers and
third-party owners of digital advertising inventory (“Publishers”) via
auctions at large scale and microsecond-level speeds. The pricing and terms
for all mobile advertising arrangements are governed by the Company’s terms
and conditions and generally stipulate payment terms of 30 days subsequent
to the end of the month. The contract is fully cancellable at any time.

Software Platform Revenue is generated by placing ads on mobile applications
owned by Publishers. The Company’s performance obligation is to provide an
advertiser with access to the Software Platform, which facilitates the
advertiser’s purchase of ad inventory from Publishers. The Company does not
control the ad inventory prior to its transfer to the advertiser, the
Company’s customer, because the Company does not have the substantive
ability to direct the use of nor obtain substantially all of the remaining
benefits from the ad inventory. The Company is not primarily responsible for
fulfillment and does not have any inventory risk. The Company is an agent as
it relates to the sale of third-party advertising inventory and presents
revenue on a net basis. The transaction price is the product of the number
of completions of agreed upon actions less consideration paid or payable to
Publishers.
Apps Revenue
Consumer Revenue

Consumer Revenue includes fees collected from users to purchase virtual
goods to enhance their gameplay experience. The identified performance
obligation is to provide users with the ability to acquire, use, and hold
virtual items over the estimated period of time the virtual items are
available to the user or until the virtual item is consumed. Payment is
required at the time of purchase, and the purchase price is a fixed amount.

Users make IAPs through the Company’s distribution partners. The transaction
price is equal to the gross amount charged to users because the Company is
the principal in the transaction. IAPs fees are non-refundable. Such
payments are initially recorded as deferred revenue. The Company categorizes
its virtual goods as either consumable or durable. Consumable virtual goods
represent goods that can be consumed by a specific player action in
gameplay; accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue from the sale of
consumable virtual goods as the goods are consumed. Durable virtual goods
represent goods that are accessible to the user over an extended period of
time; accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue from the sale of durable
virtual goods ratably over the period of time the goods are available to the
user, which is generally the estimated average user life (“EAUL”).

The EAUL represents the Company’s best estimate of the expected life of
paying users for the applicable game. The EAUL begins when a user makes the
first purchase of durable virtual goods and ends when a user is determined
to be inactive. The Company determines the EAUL on a game-by-game basis. For
a newly launched game with limited playing data, the Company determines its
EAUL based on the EAUL of a game with sufficiently similar characteristics.

The Company determines the EAUL on a quarterly basis and applies such
calculated EAUL to all bookings in the respective quarter. Determining the
EAUL is subjective and requires management’s judgment. Future playing
patterns may differ from historical playing patterns, and therefore the EAUL
may change in the future. The EAULs are generally between sixand nine
months.
Business Revenue
Business Revenue is generated by selling ad inventory on the Company's Apps
to third-party advertisers. Advertisers purchase ad inventory either through
the Software Platform or through third-party advertising networks (“Ad
Networks”). Revenue from the sale of ad inventory through Ad Networks is
recognized net of the amounts retained by Ad Networks as the Company is
unable to determine the gross amount paid by the advertisers to Ad Networks.
The Company recognizes revenue when the ad is displayed to users.
Asset Acquisitions and Business Combinations
The Company performs an initial test to determine whether substantially all
of the fair value of the gross assets transferred are concentrated in a
single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets, such
that the acquisition would not represent a business. If that test suggests
that the set of assets and activities is a business, the Company then
performs a second test to evaluate whether the assets and activities
transferred include inputs and substantive processes that together,
significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs, which would
constitute a business. If the result of the second test suggests that the
acquired assets and activities constitute a business, the Company accounts
for the transaction as a business combination.

Table of contents
For transactions accounted for as business combinations, the Company
allocates the fair value of acquisition consideration to the tangible assets
acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their
estimated fair values. Acquisition consideration includes the fair value of
any promised contingent consideration. The excess of the fair value of
acquisition consideration over the fair value of acquired identifiable
assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Contingent consideration is
remeasured to its fair value each reporting period with changes in the fair
value of contingent consideration recorded in general and administrative
expenses. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates
and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Management’s
estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be
reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and as a
result, actual results may differ from estimates. In certain circumstances,
the allocations of the excess purchase price are based upon preliminary
estimates and assumptions and subject to revision when the Company receives
final information, including appraisals and other analyses. During the
measurement period, which is one year from the acquisition date, the Company
may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with
the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement
period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings. Acquisition-
related costs are expensed as incurred.

For transactions accounted for as asset acquisitions, the cost, including
certain transaction costs, is allocated to the assets acquired on the basis
of relative fair values. The Company generally includes contingent
consideration in the cost of the assets acquired only when the uncertainty
is resolved. The Company recognizes contingent consideration adjustments to
the cost of the acquired assets prospectively using the straight-line method
over the remaining useful life of the assets. No goodwill is recognized in
asset acquisitions.
Services and Development Agreements
The Company enters into strategic agreements with mobile gaming studios
(“Partner Studios”). The Company has historically allowed these Partner
Studios to continue their operations with a significant degree of autonomy.
In some cases, the Company bought Apps from Partner Studios and entered into
service and development agreements whereby Partner Studios provide support
in improving existing Apps and developing new Apps. The substantial majority
of payments associated with service agreements for existing Apps are
expensed to research and development when the services are rendered as the
payments primarily relate to developing enhancements for the Apps. Payments
for new Apps associated with development agreements are generally made in
connection with the development of a particular App, and therefore, the
Company is subject to development risk prior to the release of the App.
Accordingly, payments that are due prior to completion of an App are
generally expensed to research and development over the development period
as the services are incurred. Payments due after completion of an App are
generally capitalized and expensed as cost of revenue. See Note 6,
“Acquisitions” for additional information.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements (Issued and Adopted)
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible
Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity , to simplify the
accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of
liabilities and equity, including convertible instruments and contracts on
an entity’s own equity. The standard eliminates beneficial conversion
feature and cash conversion models resulting in more convertible instruments
being accounted for as a single unit; and simplifies classification of debt
on the balance sheet and earnings per share calculation. The Company adopted
this ASU on January 1, 2022 with no material impact on the consolidated
financial statements.
In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations —
Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with
Customers. This ASU clarifies that an acquirer of a business should
recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business
combination in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic
606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).The Company adopted
this ASU on January 1, 2022 with no material impact on the consolidated
financial statements.

Contract Balances
Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue and include payments
received in advance of the satisfaction of performance obligations. During
the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized $
55.8million and $ 57.7million of revenue that was included in deferred
revenue as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Unsatisfied Performance Obligations
All of the Company’s unsatisfied performance obligations relate to contracts
with an original expected length of one year or less.
Publisher Bonuses
During the first quarter of 2022, the Company paid or promised to pay a
total of $ 209.6million in bonuses to publishers consisting primarily of
non-recurring bonuses to migrate publishers to MAX. The Company accounted
for such publisher bonuses as a reduction to revenue since the publishers
receiving such bonuses are also customers of the Company.

Fair value accounting is applied for all financial assets and liabilities
that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements
on a recurring basis. At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the carrying
amount of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other current
assets, other assets, accounts payable, and accrued and other current
liabilities approximated their estimated fair value due to their relatively
short maturities. The following table sets forth the Company’s financial

Marketable Equity Securities
During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the Company liquidated its
investment in Huuuge, Inc. for a total proceed of $ 2.1million and
recognized a loss of $ 0.4million on sale of such investment in other
income, net in the Company's condensed consolidated statement of operations.
For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Company recorded a total
unrealized gain of $ 5.4million in other income, net in the Company’s
condensed consolidated statement of operations related to this investment.

Non-Marketable Equity Securities

The Company held equity interests in certain private equity funds of $
18.9million and $ 3.2million as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021,
respectively, which are measured using the net asset value practical
expedient. Under the net asset value practical expedient, the Company
records its investments based on its proportionate share of the underlying
funds’ net asset value as of the Company's reporting date. These investments
are included in other assets in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance
sheets.

These funds vary in investment strategies and generally have an initial term
of 7to 10years, which may be extended for 2to 3additional years with the
applicable approval. These investments are subject to certain restrictions
regarding transfers and withdrawals and generally cannot be redeemed with
the funds. Distributions from the funds will be received as the underlying
investments are liquidated. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss is
limited to the carrying value of these investments plus the unfunded
commitments of $ 44.1million as of March 31, 2022.

During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the Company made a total
capital contribution of $ 14.1million related to these investments and
recorded an unrealized gain of $ 1.6million in other income, net in the

Commitments

As of March 31, 2022, the Company's non-cancelable minimum purchase
commitments comprised primarily of a certain arrangement related to cloud
platform services entered into in May 2021 with a remaining unpaid
commitment of $ 226.8million through May 2026. In addition, the Company had
total unfunded commitments of $ 44.1million related to its investments in
certain private equity funds (see Note 4).

Contingencies

From time to time, the Company may have certain contingent liabilities that
arise in the ordinary course of business activities. The Company accrues a
liability for such matters when it is probable that future expenditures will
be made, and such expenditures can be reasonably estimated.
Letters of Credit
As of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 the Company had outstanding
letters of credit in the aggregate amount of $ 11.1million, which were
issued as security for certain leased office facilities under the Credit
Agreement. These letters of credit have never been drawn upon.
Legal Proceedings
The Company is involved from time to time in litigation, claims, and
proceedings. The outcomes of the Company’s legal proceedings are inherently
unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainty.

Table of contents
The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been
incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If it is determined
that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be
estimated, the reasonably possible loss is disclosed. The Company evaluates
developments in legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that
has been previously accrued, and related reasonably possible losses
disclosed, and makes adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is
required to determine the likelihood of matters and the estimated amount of
losses related to such matters. To date, losses in connection with legal
proceedings have not been material.

The Company expenses legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.
Indemnifications
The Company enters into indemnification provisions under agreements with
other parties in the ordinary course of business, including certain
customers, business partners, investors, contractors and the Company’s
officers, directors and certain employees. It is not possible to determine
the maximum potential loss under these indemnification provisions due to the
Company’s limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique
facts and circumstances involved in each particular provision. To date,
losses recorded in the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of
operations in connection with the indemnification provisions have not been
material. As of March 31, 2022, the Company did not have any material
indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible.
Non-income Taxes
The Company may be subject to audit by various tax authorities with regard
to non-income tax matters. The subject matter of non-income tax audits
primarily arises from different interpretations on tax treatment and tax
rates applied. The Company accrues liabilities for non-income taxes that may
result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax
authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If a loss is
reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, the
Company discloses the reasonably possible loss.

2022 Acquisitions

Business Combinations
MoPub — On January 1, 2022, the Company completed its acquisition from
Twitter, Inc. of certain assets that comprised of its MoPub business for a
total purchase price of $ 1.03billion in cash. The acquisition allows the
Company to integrate certain product features of the MoPub platform into
MAX, our own in-app mediation platform, and migrate publishers and demand
partners from the MoPub platform to MAX. The Company accounted for the
acquisition as a business combination. The Company recognized $ 12.8million
and $ 1.6million of transaction costs in general and administrative expenses
during three months ended March 31, 2022 and the year ended December 31,
2021, respectively.
The following table summarizes the preliminary allocation of the purchase
consideration to the fair value of the assets acquired (in thousands):

The fair values assigned to the assets acquired are based on the Company's
best estimates and assumptions as of the reporting date. Noliabilities were
assumed in the transaction. The Company has completed a preliminary
valuation and expects to finalize it as soon as practical, but no later than
one year from the acquisition date.

The income approach was used to determine the preliminary fair value of the
advertiser relationships, publisher relationships, developed technology and
tradename. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the
preliminary fair value of identifiable assets acquired at the acquisition
date and is primarily attributable to
                                     15

the assembled workforce and expected synergies at the time of the
acquisition. For tax purposes, an estimated tax deductible goodwill of $
694.5million was generated as a result of this acquisition.

Contemporaneously with the signing of the asset purchase agreement, the
Company entered into an agreement for Twitter, Inc. to provide certain
transitional services to facilitate the migration of publishers and demand
partners to MAX during a three-month transitional period following the
closing of the transaction (the "TSA"). The Company accounted for the TSA as
a transaction separate from the business combination since it was negotiated
primarily for the benefit of the Company. During the three months ended
March 31, 2022, the Company recognized total expense of $ 7.0million related
to the transitional services, which was included primarily in cost of
revenue in the Company's condensed consolidated statement of operations.

The Company’s condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three
months ended March 31, 2022 includes revenue generated from the MoPub
business during the transitional period of $ 44.1million. However, due to
the significant integration of the MoPub business with MAX, it was
impractical to determine the impact of the acquired business on earnings.

Asset Acquisitions

During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the Company recognized total
earn-out costs of $ 31.7million related to asset acquisitions closed in 2021

mobile Apps, and are amortized over the remaining useful life of the
originally acquired mobile Apps. No other asset acquisition was completed
during the three-month period ended March 31, 2022.
2021 Acquisitions

2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The ESPP permits participants to purchase shares of the Company’s Class A
common stock through contributions of up to 15% of their eligible

stock at the end of each 6-month purchase period with the purchase price of
the shares being 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the Company’s
Class A common stock on the first day of an offering period or on the
exercise date. A participant may purchase a maximum of 590shares of the
Company’s Class A common stock during a purchase period. Participants may
end their participation at any time during an offering and will be paid
their accrued contributions that have not yet been used to purchase shares.
Participation ends automatically upon termination of employment with the

the Company had 635,873and 486,999shares of Class A common stock subject to
repurchase in connection with early exercised stock options, respectively.

the form of promissory notes to early exercise stock options. These
promissory notes are partially collateralized by shares and, for accounting
purposes, in-substance are nonrecourse. For accounting purposes, exercised
options via nonrecourse promissory notes are not substantive and are
continued to be treated as options. In February 2021, promissory notes
issued to executive officers in the amount of $ 20.9million were settled
through either share repurchase, in the amount of $ 17.2million, or cash
payment, in the amount of $ 3.7million. In connection with the repurchase of

Basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is
computed in conformity with the two-class method required for participating
securities. The Company considers its convertible preferred stock, options
exercised in exchange for nonrecourse promissory notes, early exercised
unvested stock options and unvested restricted stock awards to be
participating securities. Under the two-class method, the net loss
attributable to common stockholders is not allocated to convertible
preferred stock, options exercised in exchange for nonrecourse promissory
notes, early exercised unvested common stock options and unvested restricted
stock awards as the holders of these instruments do not have a contractual
obligation to share in the Company’s losses. Net income is attributed to
common stockholders and participating securities based on their
participation rights. Basic net loss per share attributable to common
stockholders is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common
stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share attributable to
common stockholders adjusts basic earnings per share for the potentially
dilutive impact of stock options.
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net loss
per share attributable to common stockholders (in thousands, except share
and per share data):

expand into the Connected TV market. The acquisition will be accounted for
as a business combination and, accordingly, the total purchase price will be
allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective
fair values on the acquisition date. Due to the timing of the close, as of
the date of issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements,
the acquisition accounting is incomplete as the Company is still in the
process of estimating the initial purchase price allocation. As a result,
the Company is unable to provide this information as well as the pro forma
financial information of the combined entity, which will be reported on its
Form 10-Q for the quarter ending June 30, 2022. The Company incurred
transaction costs of approximately $ 1.7million included in the general and
administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2022, in
connection with the business combination for legal and accounting fees.
Concurrent with entering into the definitive agreement, the Company also
adopted a multi-year performance-based incentive plan for certain key
employees of Wurl, under which the key employees may earn up to a total of $
600.0million in additional shares of the Company's Class A common stock
through 2025, contingent upon the achievement of certain revenue and other
performance targets by the acquired business and the continued employment of
such key employees. Such plan became effective at the closing of the
transaction.

In April 2022, the Company granted 1,192,676RSUs under the 2021 Plan to new
employees who joined the Company in connection with the acquisition of Wurl.
Such RSUs include vesting terms of approximately four years, subject to
continuous employment, and have a grant date fair value of $ 46.74per share.

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results
of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated
financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. This
discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and
uncertainties. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences
include those identified below and those discussed in the section titled
“Risk Factors” and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our
historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be
expected for any period in the future.
                                                                            
   Overview                                                                 
                                                                            
Our mission is to grow the mobile app ecosystem by enabling the success of
mobile app developers. Our software solutions provide advanced tools for
mobile app developers to grow their businesses by automating and optimizing
the marketing and monetization of their apps. Our software, coupled with our
deep industry knowledge and expertise, has allowed us to rapidly scale a
successful and diversified portfolio of owned mobile apps. We have also
accelerated our market penetration through an active acquisition and
partnership strategy. Our scaled and integrated business model sits at the
nexus of the mobile app ecosystem, which creates a durable competitive
advantage that has fueled our clients’ success and our strong growth.

Since our founding in 2011, we have been focused on building a software-
based platform for mobile app developers to improve the marketing and
monetization of their apps. Our founders, who are mobile app developers
themselves, quickly realized the real impediment to success and growth in
the mobile app ecosystem was a discovery and monetization problem—breaking
through the congested app stores to efficiently find users and successfully
grow their business. Their first-hand experience with these developer
challenges led to the development of our infrastructure and
software—AppLovin Core Technologies and AppLovin Software Platform. We
capitalized on our success and understanding of the mobile app ecosystem by
launching AppLovin Apps in 2018. Our Apps now consist of a globally
diversified portfolio of over 350 free-to-play mobile games across five
genres, run by nineteen studios.

For the three months ended March 31, 2022, our revenue grew 4% year-over-
year, from $603.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 to
$625.4 million in the comparative period in 2022. We generated a net loss of
$115.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, and a net loss of
$10.6 million in the comparative period in 2021. We generated Adjusted
EBITDA of $276.2 million, and $131.1 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Additionally, our net cash provided
by (used in) operating activities was $31.7 million and $61.8 million in the
three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. See the section
titled “Non-GAAP Financial Metrics” for a definition of Adjusted EBITDA and
a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly
comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP.
                                                                            
   Our Business Model                                                       
                                                                            
We collect revenue from our Software Platform and our Apps. During the three
months ended March 31, 2022, Software Platform Revenue represented 19% of
total revenue and Apps Revenue represented 81% of total revenue.
As a result of the strategic review of our Apps portfolio, which we
announced in our shareholder letter on May 11th, 2022 and which we discuss
below, we have updated the presentation of our revenue and associated
discussion within this filing to align with how our management reviews our
revenue and financial performance.
                                                                            
  Software Platform Revenue                                                 
                                                                            
We generate Software Platform Revenue from fees paid by mobile app
advertisers who use our Software Platform to grow and monetize their apps.
We are able to grow our Software Platform Revenue by improving our various
software technologies.

Software Platform clients include a wide variety of advertisers, from indie
developer studios to some of the largest global internet platforms, such as
Facebook and Google. While we have thousands of clients as of March 31,
2022, the vast majority of our revenue is derived from our Software Platform
Enterprise Clients. See “Key Metrics” below for additional information on
how we calculate Software Platform Enterprise Clients. We see multiple
opportunities to gain new Software Platform clients, and to increase spend
from existing clients, as we help them grow their businesses and make them
more successful.

Our Software Platform includes AppDiscovery, Adjust and MAX. Clients use
AppDiscovery to automate, optimize, and manage their user acquisition
investments. They set marketing and user growth goals, and AppDiscovery
optimizes their ad spend in an effort to achieve their return on advertising
spend targets and other marketing objectives. AppDiscovery comprises the
vast majority of revenue from our Software Platform. Revenue is generated
from our advertisers, typically on a performance-based, cost-per-install
basis, and shared with our advertising publishers, typically on a cost per
impression model. Our Software Platform Enterprise Clients had a Net Dollar-
Based Retention Rate of approximately 137% for the three months ended March
31, 2022. 1

Software Platform clients use Adjust's SaaS mobile marketing platform to
better understand their users' journey while allowing marketers to make
smarter decisions through measurement, attribution and fraud prevention.
Revenue from Adjust is primarily generated from an annual software
subscription fee.

Software Platform clients use MAX to optimize purchases of app advertising
inventory. The Compass Analytics tool within MAX provides insights to manage
against key performance indicators, understand the long-term value of users,
and help manage profitability. Revenue from MAX is generated based on a
percentage of client spend. As more developers move to in-app bidding
monetization, we expect growth in the adoption of, and revenue from, MAX.
                                                                            
  Apps Revenue                                                              
                                                                            
Apps Revenue is generated when a user of one of our Apps makes an in-app
purchase ("IAP") ("Consumer Revenue") and when clients purchase the digital
advertising inventory of our portfolio of Apps ("Business Revenue"). We are
able to grow our Apps Revenue by adding more apps to our Apps portfolio and
increasing engagement on our existing Apps.

Our Apps are generally free-to-play mobile games and generate Consumer
Revenue through IAPs. IAPs consist of virtual goods used to enhance
gameplay, accelerate access to certain features or levels, and augment other
mobile game progression opportunities for the user. IAPs drive more
engagement and better economics from our Apps. The vast majority of our IAP
revenue flows through two app stores, Apple App Store and Google Play, which
charge us a standard commission on IAPs. Consumer Revenue represented 67% of
total Apps Revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2022.

During the three months ended March 31, 2022, we had an average of 2.7
million Monthly Active Payers ("MAPs") across our portfolio of Apps. Over
that period, we had an Average Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer ("ARPMAP")
of $41. Leveraging the benefit of our integrated Platform and Apps, we see
opportunities to grow our App-related revenue streams by increasing MAPs and
expanding ARPMAP within existing games and through new game development,
acquisitions and partnerships. See “Key Metrics” below for additional
information on how we calculate MAPs and ARPMAP.

Business clients that purchase advertising inventory from our Apps are able
to target highly relevant users from our diverse and global portfolio of
over 350 mobile games. Our clients leverage a broad set of high-performing
mobile ad formats, including playable and rewarded video, and are able to
match these ads with relevant users resulting in a better return on their
advertising spend. By increasing the number of users and their engagement,
as well as better matching ads with the appropriate target audience, we are
able to increase our revenue from business clients that purchase advertising
inventory from our Apps. Revenue from business clients related to our Apps
is generated from ads purchased by advertisers, as well as from revenue-
sharing agreements between some of our studios and a selection of third-
party studios for which they publish and monetize games. Business Revenue
represented 33% of total Apps Revenue in the three months ended March 31,
2022.
1 We measure Net Dollar-Based Retention Rate for the three months ended
March 31, 2022 for our Software Platform Enterprise Clients as current
period revenue divided by prior period revenue. Prior period revenue is
measured as revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2021 from our
Software Platform Enterprise Clients as of March 31, 2021. Current period
revenue is revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2022 from Software
Platform Enterprise Clients as of March 31, 2021. See the section titled
"Key Metrics--Update to our Key Metrics" below.

We review the following key metrics on a regular basis in order to evaluate
the health of our business, identify trends affecting our performance,
prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions.
Software Platform Enterprise Clients ("SPECs"). We focus on the number of
Software Platform Enterprise Clients, which are third-party clients from
whom we have collected greater than $31,250 of Software Platform revenue in
the three months to a given date, equating to an annual run-rate of $125,000
in revenue. Software Platform Enterprise Clients generate the vast majority
of our Business Revenue - Software Platform and Business Revenue - Software
Platform growth.

Revenue Per Software Platform Enterprise Client ("Revenue per SPEC") . We
define Revenue per SPEC as (i) the total revenue derived from our Software
Platform Enterprise Clients in a three-month period, divided by (ii)
Software Platform Enterprise Clients as of the end of that same period.
Revenue per SPEC shows how efficiently we are monetizing each SPEC. We
expect to increase Revenue per SPEC over time as we enhance our Software
Platform and Apps.

The following table shows our Software Platform Enterprise Clients and
Revenue per SPEC for the three months March 31, 2022 and 2021.

Beginning with the three months ended June 30, 2022, the revenue measurement
period used to determine the number of SPECs in a period will be updated to
include clients from whom we have collected greater than $125,000 in
Software Platform revenue over the trailing 12 months. The current
definition of SPEC includes third-party clients who had more than $31,250 in
Software Platform revenue for the prior three months. We believe this change
in revenue measurement period will provide additional information regarding
the scale and growth of our more-mature clients. Going forward, when Net
Dollar-Based Revenue Retention ("NDBRR") measures are provided, we will also
calculate such measures using the updated definition of SPECs.

The table below shows our SPEC and Revenue per SPEC as of March 31, 2022 and
2021 under the updated calculations.

Total Software Transaction Value ("TSTV"). Software Platform revenue is from
third-party clients using our Software Platform to find new customers. We do
not recognize revenue from our own spend on our Software Platform.
Therefore, we use TSTV to measure the scale and growth rates of our Software
Platform, as it reflects the total value on our Software Platform including
our first-party studios as though they were stand-alone businesses.

The following table shows our Total Software Transaction Value for the three
months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021.

Monthly Active Payers ("MAPs"). We define a MAP as a unique mobile device
active on one of our Apps in a month that completed at least one IAP during
that time period. A consumer who makes IAPs within two separate Apps on the
same mobile device in a monthly period will be counted as two MAPs. MAPs for
a particular time period longer than one month are the average MAPs for each
month during that period. We estimate the number of MAPs by aggregating
certain data from third-party attribution partners. Some of our Apps do not
utilize such third-party attribution partners, and therefore our MAPs figure
for any period does not capture every user that completed an
                                     23                                     
Table of contents
IAP on our Apps. We estimate that our counted MAPs generated approximately
97% of our Consumer Revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2022,
and as such, management believes that MAPs are still a useful metric to
measure the engagement and monetization potential of our games. We expect to
increase our MAPs over time as we increase the number of our Apps and
enhance the engagement and monetization of our Apps.

Average Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer ("ARPMAP"). We define ARPMAP as (i)
the total Consumer Revenue derived from our Apps in a monthly period,
divided by (ii) MAPs in that same period. ARPMAP for a particular time
period longer than one month is the average ARPMAP for each month during
that period. ARPMAP shows how efficiently we are monetizing each MAP. We
expect to increase ARPMAP over time as we enhance the monetization of our
Apps.

Our key metrics are not based on any standardized industry methodology and
are not necessarily calculated in the same manner or comparable to similarly
titled measures presented by other companies. Similarly, our key metrics may
differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled
metrics of our competitors due to differences in methodology. The numbers
that we use to calculate TSTV, MAP, and ARPMAP are based on internal data.
While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable judgments
and estimates for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent
challenges in measuring usage and engagement. We regularly review and may
adjust our processes for calculating our internal metrics to improve their
accuracy.

before interest expense and loss on settlement of debt, other (income)
expense, net (excluding certain recurring items), provision for (benefit
from) income taxes, amortization, depreciation and write-offs and as further
adjusted for stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expense
and transaction bonus, publisher bonuses, MoPub acquisition transition
services, loss (gain) on extinguishments of acquisition related continent
consideration, non-operating foreign exchange losses, lease modification and
abandonment of leasehold improvements, and change in the fair value of
contingent consideration. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted
EBITDA divided by revenue for the same period.

Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are key measures we use to assess
our financial performance and are also used for internal planning and
forecasting purposes. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin
are helpful to investors, analysts, and other interested parties because
they can assist in providing a more consistent and comparable overview of
our operations across our historical financial periods. In addition, these
measures are frequently used by analysts, investors, and other interested
parties to evaluate and assess performance. We use Adjusted EBITDA and
Adjusted EBITDA margin in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our
overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation of our
annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the
effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with our board
of directors concerning our financial performance.

Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are non-GAAP financial measures
and are presented for supplemental informational purposes only and should
not be considered as alternatives or substitutes to financial information
presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures have certain limitations
in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are
reflected in our consolidated statement of operations that are necessary to
run our business. Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by
other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition,
other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Furthermore, these
metrics have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of
certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of
operations that are necessary to run our business. Thus, our Adjusted EBITDA
and Adjusted EBITDA margin should be considered in addition to, not as
substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with
GAAP.

  Factors Affecting Our Performance                                         
                                                                            
We believe that the future success of our business depends on many factors,
including the factors described below. While each of these factors presents
significant opportunities for our business, they also pose important
challenges that we must successfully address in order to continue to grow
profitably while maintaining strong cash flow.
                                                                            
  Continue to invest in innovation                                          
                                                                            
We have made, and intend to continue to make, significant investments in our
Core Technologies and Software Platform to enhance their effectiveness and
value proposition for our clients. We expect that these investments will
require spending on research and development, and acquisitions and
partnerships related to technology components and products. We believe
investments in our software, including AXON, AppDiscovery, Adjust and MAX,
will further improve their effectiveness for developers. Our investments
will also allow us to enter new mobile app sectors outside of gaming. While
our investments in research and development and acquisitions and
partnerships may not result in revenue in the near term, we believe these
investments position us to increase our revenue over time.
                                                                            
  Retain and grow existing clients                                          
                                                                            
We rely on existing clients for a significant portion of our revenue. As we
improve our Software Platform and Apps, we can attract additional spend from
these clients. Our clients include indie studio developers and some of the
largest mobile advertising platforms in the world. We believe there is
significant room for us to further expand our relationships with these
clients and increase their usage of our Software Platform. We have invested
in targeted sales and account-based marketing efforts, including through
Adjust’s sales and marketing teams, to identify and showcase opportunities
to clients and plan to continue to do so in the future.
In the past, our clients have generally increased their usage of our
Software Platform and Apps, and as a result, growth from existing clients
has been a primary driver of our revenue growth. We must continue to retain
our existing clients and expand their spend with us over time to continue to
grow our revenue, increase profitability and drive greater cash flow.

3 In association with the MoPub acquisition, we incurred certain costs to
incentivize publishers to migrate to our MAX mediation solution including
existing publishers of MoPub as well as publishers on other competitor
offerings, and to retain certain existing MAX publishers. These costs were
reflected as a reduction to revenue in the period. We have not historically
incurred significant publisher migration costs, nor do we currently intend
to incur significant publisher migration costs in the future. As such, we
have removed the impact of these costs from Adjusted EBITDA.

  Add new clients globally                                                  
                                                                            
Our future success depends in part on our ability to acquire new clients. We
recently increased our focus on markets outside the United States to serve
the needs of clients globally. During the three months ended March 31, 2022,
only 43% of our revenue from Software Platform and Apps Business Revenue
clients was generated from outside of the United States. We believe that the
global opportunity is significant and will continue to expand as developers
and advertisers outside the United States adopt our Software Platform and
advertise on our Apps. We also see opportunities to acquire new clients
outside of mobile gaming, as the capabilities of our Core Technologies and
Software Platform are relevant to the broader mobile app ecosystem. We are
investing in direct sales, product development, education, and other
capabilities to drive increased awareness and adoption of our Software
Platform and Apps, which investments may impact our profitability in the
near term as we seek further scale. We must continue to acquire new clients
to grow our revenue, increase profitability, and drive greater cash flow.
                                                                            
  Review of our AppLovin Apps portfolio                                     
                                                                            
Over the past several years, our Apps have been critical in providing first-
party data and audiences for our Software Platform to enable us to test,
design, and scale our technologies, Given the recent development of our
technology, the current scale of our Software Platform, and the reach of our
MAX solution, we believe we can reduce our reliance on the data from our
Apps. Therefore, we are reviewing our Apps portfolio and its cost structure,
focusing on how best to optimize each asset’s contribution to our overall
financial performance. This review may result in the retention, restructure,
or sale of certain assets, or no change to our Apps portfolio. We may also
choose to make certain changes to optimize the cost structure of certain
Apps rather than continuing to invest in revenue growth. We believe that our
execution of this review, and our ability to optimize the contribution of
our Apps portfolio, will affect our revenue growth, profitability, and cash
flow.
Continued execution of strategic acquisitions and partnerships
We intend to continue to make strategic acquisitions and enter into
strategic partnerships to grow our business. From the beginning of 2018
through March 31, 2022, we have invested over $2.5 billion in 28 strategic
acquisitions and partnerships with mobile app developers and for
technologies to enhance our Software Platform including the acquisition of
MAX in 2018, Adjust in April 2021 and MoPub in January 2022.

While we have a strong pipeline of strategic acquisition and partnership
opportunities, we believe our future results of operations will be affected
by our ability to continue to identify and execute such transactions that
are accretive to our growth and profitability.
                                                                            
  Growth and structure of the mobile app ecosystem                          
                                                                            
Our business and results of operations will be impacted by industry factors
that drive overall performance of the mobile app ecosystem. The mobile app
ecosystem has grown rapidly in recent years. We expect that any
acceleration, or slowing, of this growth would affect our business and
results of operations. In addition, even if the mobile app ecosystem
continues to grow at its current rate, our ability to position ourselves
within the market will impact our business and results of operations.

Mobile app developers, including AppLovin, rely on third-party platforms,
such as the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, among others, to
distribute games, collect payments made for IAPs, and target users with
relevant advertising. We expect this to continue for the foreseeable future.
These third-party platforms have significant market power and discretion to
set platform fees, select which apps to promote, and decide how much
consumer information to provide to advertising networks that enable our Core
Technologies and Software Platform to target users with personalized and
relevant advertising and allocate marketing campaigns in an efficient and
cost-effective manner. Any changes made in the policies of third-party
platforms could drive rapid change across the mobile app ecosystem. For
example, in April 2021, Apple started implementing its application tracking
transparency framework that, among other things, requires users' opt-in
consent for certain types of tracking. While this transparency framework has
not had a significant impact on our overall business, it may in the future
continue to have an impact on it, including the effectiveness of our
advertising practices and/or our ability to efficiently generate revenue for
our Apps. We rely in part on Identifier for Advertisers ("IDFA") to provide
us with data that helps our Software Platform better market and monetize
Apps. The IDFA and transparency changes may require us to engage in
significant changes to our data collection practices, which may require our
expenditure of substantial costs and resources, and to the extent we are
unable to utilize IDFA or a similar offering, or if the transparency changes
and any related opt-in or other requirements result in decreases in the
availability or utility of data relating to Apps, our Software Platform may
not be as effective, we may not be able to continue to efficiently generate
revenue for our Apps, and our revenue and results of operations may be
harmed. Additionally, Apple implemented new requirements for consumer
disclosures regarding privacy and data processing practices in December
2020, which
                                     26

has resulted in increased compliance requirements and could result in
decreased usage of our Apps. In February 2022, Google announced it planned
to adopt restrictions to restrict tracking activity across Android devices.
These or any similar changes to the policies of Apple or Google may
materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and
results of operations. To date, these data privacy changes have had a
relatively muted aggregate impact on our overall results of operations.

New tools for developers, industry standards, and platforms may emerge in
the future. We believe our focus on the mobile app ecosystem has allowed us
to understand the needs of our clients and our relentless innovation has
enabled us to quickly adapt to changes in the industry and pioneer new
solutions. We must continue to innovate and stay ahead of developments in
the mobile app ecosystem in order for our business to succeed and our
results of operations to continue to improve.

The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting social distancing and shelter-in-place
orders put in place around the world have caused widespread disruption in
global economies, productivity, and financial markets and have altered the
way in which we conduct our day-to-day business. Our Software Platform and
Apps do not require physical interaction, thus, our ability to meet the
needs of our clients and users has not been materially affected. The full
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and the extent to
which the pandemic may impact our business, financial condition, and results
of operations in the future remains uncertain. See the section titled “Risk
Factors—The COVID-19 pandemic and responses thereto across the globe have
altered how individuals interact with each other and affected how we and our
business partners are operating, and the extent to which this situation will
impact our future results of operations remains uncertain” for additional
information.

We collect Software Platform Revenue from advertisers spending on our
Software Platform. Software Platform Revenue is generated from our
advertisers, typically on a performance-based, cost-per-install basis, then
shared with our advertising publishers, typically on a cost per impression
model.

We generate Apps revenue from both consumers and business clients. Consumer
Revenue is from consumer IAPs made by users within our Apps. Business
Revenue is generated from advertisers that purchase advertising inventory
from our diverse portfolio of Apps. Business Revenue from our Apps was 33%
of total Apps Revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2022.
                                                                            
  Cost of Revenue and Operating Expenses                                    
                                                                            
Cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of third-party payment
processing fees for distribution partners, amortization of acquired
technology-related intangible assets, and expenses associated with operating
our network infrastructure. Third-party payment processing fees relate to
Consumer Revenue. The fees for IAPs are processed and collected by third-
party distribution partners. Network operating costs include bandwidth,
energy, other equipment costs related to our co-located data centers and
costs for third-party cloud service providers. We expect our cost of revenue
to increase in absolute dollars over the long term as our business and
revenue continue to grow. We also expect our cost of revenue as a percentage
of revenue to fluctuate period-over-period.

Sales and marketing . Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of user
acquisition costs, other advertising expenses, personnel-related expenses
for salaries, employee benefits, and stock-based compensation for employees
engaged in sales and marketing, and amortization of acquired user-related
intangible assets, marketing programs, travel, customer service costs, and
allocated facilities and information technology costs.

We plan to continue to invest in sales and marketing to grow our customer
base and increase brand awareness. As a result, we expect sales and
marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars. We also expect our sales
and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue to fluctuate period-over-
period in the near term as we invest to grow our customer base and increase
brand awareness, and to decrease over the long term as we benefit from
greater scale.

Research and development. Research and development expenses consist
primarily of product development costs, including personnel-related expenses
for salaries, employee benefits, and stock-based compensation for employees
engaged in research and development, professional services costs related to
development of new apps by third parties, consulting costs, regulatory
compliance costs, and allocated facilities and information technology costs.

We plan to continue to invest in research and development to continue to
enhance our Core Technologies and Software Platform, and to improve existing
games and develop new games. As a result, we expect research and development
expenses to increase in absolute dollars. We also expect our research and
development expenses as a percentage of revenue to fluctuate period-over-
period in the near term as we invest to enhance our Core Technologies and
Software Platform and improve our existing Apps and develop new Apps, and to
decrease over the long term as we benefit from greater scale.

General and administrative . General and administrative expenses consist
primarily of costs incurred to support our business, including personnel-
related expenses for salaries, employee benefits, and stock-based
compensation for employees engaged in finance, accounting, legal, human
resources and administration, professional services fees for legal,
accounting, recruiting, and administrative services (including acquisition-
related expenses), insurance, travel, and allocated facilities and
information technology costs.

We plan to continue to invest in our general and administrative function to
support the growth of our business. In addition, we expect to incur
additional general and administrative expenses as a result of operating as a
public company, including expenses related to compliance and reporting
obligations of a public company, increased insurance and investor relations
expenses, and increased professional services fees (including acquisition-
related expenses). As a result, we expect general and administrative
expenses to increase in absolute dollars. We also expect our general and
administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue to fluctuate period-over-
period in the near term as we invest to support the growth of our business,
and to decrease over the long term as we benefit from greater scale.

Interest expense and loss on settlement of debt. Interest expense and loss
on settlement of debt consists primarily of loss related to debt
extinguishment, interest expense associated with our outstanding debt,
including accretion of debt discount, and changes in fair value of interest
rate swap accounted for as a cash flow hedge related to the stream of
variable interest payments associated with a portion of our outstanding
debt.

Other income, net. Other income, net, includes interest earned on our cash
and cash equivalents, gains and losses related to embedded derivatives and
other financial instruments accounted for at fair value, and foreign
currency exchange gains (losses), which consist primarily of remeasurement
of transactions and monetary assets and liabilities denominated in
currencies other than the functional currency at the end of the period.

Benefit from income taxes. We are subject to income taxes in the United
States and foreign jurisdictions in which we do business. These foreign
jurisdictions have different statutory tax rates than those in the United
States. Additionally, certain of our foreign earnings may also be taxable in
the United States. Accordingly, our effective tax rate will vary depending
on the relative proportion of foreign to domestic income, impacts from
acquisition restructuring, deduction benefits related to foreign-derived
intangible income, future changes in the valuation of our deferred tax
assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws. Additionally, our effective
tax rate can vary based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss.

Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 Compared to Three Months Ended March 31,
2021

Total revenue increased by $21.5 million, or 4%, for the three months ended
March 31, 2022 compared to the prior year period due to increases in
Software Platform Revenue of 34% and Business Revenue of 6%, partially
offset by a decline in Consumer Revenue of 5%.

For the three months ended March 31, 2022, our Software Platform Revenue
increased by $30.4 million from the prior year period primarily due to
AppDiscovery where installations increased 45% and price per installation
increased 113% compared to the prior year period, as well as the
contribution from MoPub and Adjust, partially offset by publisher bonuses of
$209.6 million, which are accounted for as a reduction to revenue since the
publishers receiving such bonuses are also our customers. Usage of
advertising inventory by our Owned Studios and Partner Studios represented
15% of installations during the three months ended March 31, 2022. We do not
recognize Software Platform Revenue from transactions with our Owned Studios
and Partner Studios.

For the three months ended March 31, 2022, our Apps Revenue decreased by
$8.9 million from the prior year period. For the three months ended March
31, 2022, our Consumer Revenue decreased by $19.0 million from the prior
year period, primarily due to a 12% decrease in the volume of in-app
purchases, partially offset by a 8% increase in price per in-app purchase.
Existing and newly developed Apps by our Owned and Partner Studios
contributed $116.4 million of the decrease, while Apps acquired since March
31, 2021 generated a partially offsetting increase of $97.4 million. The
increase in our Business Revenue from Apps of $10.1 million was primarily a
result of increased advertising revenue from acquired Apps which contributed
an increase of $25.5 million partially offset by a net decrease of $15.4
million from existing and newly developed Apps by our Owned and Partner
Studios. Our Business Revenue from Apps grew due to a 11% increase in the
volume of advertising impressions partially offset by a 4% decrease in price
per advertising impression compared to the prior year period. We do not

Cost of revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2022 increased by $58.7
million, or 26%, compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase
in the three months ended March 31, 2022 was primarily due to an increase of
$27.3 million in depreciation and amortization of acquired-technology driven
by an increase in acquisition activity subsequent to the prior year period,
an increase of $26.9 million in expenses associated with operating our
network infrastructure driven by the growth in our operations and an
increase of $5.6 million in professional services to support our network
infrastructure, partially offset by a decrease of $9.0 million in third-
party payment processing fees paid associated with in-app purchases.

Sales and marketing expenses in the three months ended March 31, 2022
increased by $24.6 million, or 9%, compared to the same period in the prior
year primarily due to an increase of $15.1 million in personnel-related
expenses related to an increase in stock-based compensation as a result of
higher grant date fair value of our common stock and an increase in
headcount, an increase of $13.2 million in depreciation and amortization of
intangible assets driven by an increase in acquisition activity, and an
increase of $9.3 million in professional services costs, offset by a $15.8
million decrease in user acquisition costs.

In the three months ended March 31, 2022, interest expense and loss on
settlement of debt decreased by $3.0 million, or 9% compared to the same

settlement of term loans of $16.9 million during the prior year period,
offset by an increase of $12.3 million in interest expense related to an
increase in the term loans balance.

million related to term loan embedded derivative in the prior year period.

In the three months ended March 31, 2022, benefit from income taxes
increased by $39.5 million or 1,242% compared to the same period in the
prior year. The increase in tax benefit was driven by an increase of $34.9
million due to higher pre-tax loss during the three months ended March 31,
2022, an increase of $21.6 million due to stock-based compensation expense,
an increase of $21.3 million due to global intangible low-taxed income, an
increase of $17.9 million due to valuation allowance, and an increase of
$4.2 million due to foreign income taxed at different rates, partially
offset by a decrease of $48.9 million due to foreign derived intangible
income deduction, $9.5 million due to research and development credit, and
$3.9 million due to foreign income inclusion.

Since inception, we financed our operations primarily through payments
received from clients using our Software Platform and advertising on our
Apps, and from user IAPs from our Apps, and through net proceeds we received
from the sales of our convertible preferred stock and borrowings made under
our Credit Agreement. As of March 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents
of $1.41 billion.

We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents would be sufficient
to satisfy our anticipated working capital and capital expenditures needs
for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements, however,
will depend on many factors, including our growth rate; expansion of sales
and marketing activities; timing and extent of spending to support our
research and development efforts; capital expenditures to purchase hardware
and software; and our continued need to invest in our IT infrastructure to
support our growth. In addition, we may enter into additional strategic
partnerships as well as agreements to acquire or invest in teams and
technologies, including intellectual property rights, which could increase
our cash requirements. As a result of these and other factors, we may be
required to seek additional equity or debt financing sooner than we
currently anticipate. If additional financing from outside sources is
required, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us, or at
all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when required, or if we
cannot expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business
opportunities because we lack sufficient capital, our business, financial
condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.

The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:

On February 23, 2022 we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Wurl,
Inc., a software platform company in the Connected TV ("CTV") market. We
completed the acquisition in April 2022 for a total purchase price of
approximately $379.0 million, consisting of $220.0 million in cash,
2,579,692 shares of our Class A common stock valued at $137.0 million and a
liability of $22.0 million representing the present value of an indemnity
holdback amount of $23.0 million to be paid in 18 months following the
closing of the transaction. Concurrent with entering into the definitive
agreement, we also adopted a multi-year performance-based incentive plan for
certain key employees of Wurl, under which the key employees may earn up to
a total of $600.0 million in additional shares of our Class A common stock
through 2025, contingent upon the achievement of certain revenue and other
performance targets by the acquired business and the continued employment of
such key employees. Such plan became effective at the closing of the
transaction.

In the first quarter of 2022, we invested or committed to invest in certain
private equity funds with total unfunded commitments of $44.1 million as of
March 31, 2022.

With the exception of the transactions described above and except for

Our condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance
with GAAP. The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial
statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as
the reported revenue generated and expenses incurred during the reporting
periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various
other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the
results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying
value of assets and liabilities and the amount of revenue and expenses that
are not readily apparent from other sources. On an ongoing basis, we
evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from
these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and
estimates during the three months ended March 31, 2022, as compared to those
disclosed in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed
with the SEC.

We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business, which
primarily relate to fluctuations in interest rates.

As of March 31, 2022, we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $1.41
billion. A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates would not have a
material impact on our financial condition or results of operations due to
the short-term nature of our cash equivalents.

As of March 31, 2022, we had a debt balance of $3.27 billion. A hypothetical
50 basis point change in interest rates as of March 31, 2022 would not have
a material impact on our net income for the three months ended March 31,
2022.

   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures                         
                                                                            
Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of
such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a
reasonable assurance level.
                                                                            
  Changes in Internal Control                                               
                                                                            
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
identified in management’s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or
15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the period covered by this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
                                                                            
   Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures                  
                                                                            
Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures
or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and
all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can
provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect
the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls
must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent
limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide
absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any,
have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that
judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur
because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be
circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or
more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any
system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the
likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design
will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may
deteriorate. Due to inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system,
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims that
arise in the ordinary course of business, as well as governmental and other
regulatory investigations and proceedings. In addition, third parties may
from time to time assert claims against us in the form of letters and other
communications. We are not currently a party to any legal proceedings that,
if determined adversely to us, would, in our opinion, have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations,
or cash flows. Future litigation may be necessary to defend ourselves and
our business partners and to determine the scope, enforceability, and
validity of third-party proprietary rights, or to establish our proprietary
rights. The results of any current or future litigation cannot be predicted
with certainty, and regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an
adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of
management resources, and other factors.

You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below,
together with all of the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q, including our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
and the related notes and the section titled “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Our business,
financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could also be
adversely affected by risks and uncertainties that are not presently known
to us or that we currently believe are not material. If any of the risks
actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations,
and prospects could be adversely affected. In that event, the market price
of our Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of
your investment.
                                                                            
  Risk Factor Summary

   Risks Related to Our Business and Industry                               
                                                                            
We have a limited operating history, especially with respect to our AppLovin
Apps, which makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future
performance and the risks we may encounter.
Our limited operating history, especially with respect to our AppLovin Apps,
which we launched in 2018, may make it difficult to evaluate our current
business and our future performance. We have encountered and will continue
to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing
companies in rapidly changing industries, such as the mobile app ecosystem,
including our ability to:

• accurately forecast our revenue and plan our operating expenses;

• attract new and retain existing clients using AppLovin Software Platform
and users of our Apps;

• successfully compete with current and future competitors, some of whom are
also our clients;

• successfully expand our business in existing markets and enter new markets
and geographies;

• successfully execute strategic acquisitions and partnerships;

• develop a scalable, high-performance technology infrastructure that can
efficiently and reliably handle increased usage, as well as the deployment
of new features and services;

• comply with existing and new laws and regulations applicable to our
business;

• anticipate and respond to macroeconomic changes and changes in the markets
in which we operate;

• establish and maintain our brand and reputation;

• adapt to rapidly evolving trends in the ways businesses and consumers
interact with technology;

• effectively manage our rapid growth;

• avoid interruptions or disruptions in our AppLovin Core Technologies,
Software Platform, or Apps; and

• hire, integrate, and retain key personnel.

Further, because we have limited historical financial data, including
limited data regarding the integration of our strategic acquisitions and
partnerships, and operate in a rapidly evolving market, any financial
planning and forecasting, including predictions about our future revenue and
expenses, may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer
operating history or operated in a more predictable market. If our
assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan
and operate our business, are incorrect or change, or if we do not address
these risks successfully, our results of operations could differ materially
from our expectations. If we fail to address the risks and uncertainties
that we face, including those described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors”
section, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could
be adversely affected.

Our results of operations are likely to fluctuate from period-to-period,
which could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.

Our results of operations have fluctuated in the past and are likely to
fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year in the
future for a variety of reasons, many of which are outside of our control
and difficult

to predict. As a result, you should not rely upon our historical results of
operations as indicators of future performance. Numerous factors can
influence our results of operations, including:

• our ability to maintain and grow our business client and user bases;

• changes to our Core Technologies, Software Platform, Apps, or other
offerings, or the development and introduction of new software or
development of new mobile apps by our studios or our competitors;

• changes to the policies or practices of companies or governmental agencies
that determine access to third-party platforms, such as the Apple App Store
and the Google Play Store, or to our Software Platform, Apps, website, or
the internet generally;

• changes to the policies or practices of third-party platforms, such as the
Apple App Store and the Google Play Store, including with respect to Apple’s
Identifier for Advertisers ("IDFA"), which helps advertisers assess the
effectiveness of their advertising efforts, and with respect to transparency
regarding data processing;

• the diversification and growth of revenue sources beyond our current
Software Platform and Apps;

• our ability to achieve the anticipated synergies from our strategic
acquisitions and effectively integrate new assets and businesses acquired by
us;

• our strategic review of our Apps portfolio;

• the actions of our competitors, both with respect to their own offerings
and, to the extent such competitors are also our clients, with respect to
their use of our Software Platform;

• costs and expenses related to the strategic acquisitions and partnerships,
including costs related to integrating mobile gaming studios or other
companies that we acquire, as well as costs and expenses related to the
development of our Core Technologies, Software Platform, or Apps;

• our ability to achieve or maintain profitability;

• increases in and timing of operating expenses that we may incur to grow
and expand our operations and to remain competitive;

• system failures or outages, or actual or perceived breaches of security or
privacy, and the costs associated with preventing, responding to, or
remediating any such outages or breaches;

• changes in the legislative or regulatory environment, including with
respect to privacy and data protection, or actions by governments or
regulators, including fines, orders, or consent decrees;

• charges associated with impairment of any assets on our balance sheet or
changes in our expected estimated useful life of property and equipment and
intangible assets;

• adverse litigation judgments, settlements, or other litigation-related
costs and the fees associated with investigating and defending claims;

• the overall tax rate for our business, which may be affected by the mix of
income we earn in the United States and in jurisdictions with comparatively
lower tax rates;

• the impact of changes in tax laws or judicial or regulatory
interpretations of tax laws, which are recorded in the period such laws are
enacted or interpretations are issued and may significantly affect the
effective tax rate of that period;

• the application of new or changing financial accounting standards or
practices; and

• changes in regional or global business or macroeconomic conditions,
including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may impact the other
factors described above.

In particular, it is difficult to predict if, when, or how quickly newly-
launched software may begin to generate revenue or decline in popularity.
Further, we cannot be certain if a new App will become popular amongst users
and generate revenue. The success of our business depends in part on our
ability to develop and enhance our Core Technologies, Software Platform and
consistently and timely launch new Apps. It is difficult for us to predict
with certainty when we will expand our Software Platform suite or launch a
new App as we may require longer development schedules or soft launch
periods to meet our quality standards and expectations. If our clients do
not adopt our new Software Platform offerings, or develop or further invest
in their own competing alternatives, or if we are unable to successfully
launch or acquire new Apps or maintain or improve existing Apps, our
business and

results of operations could be adversely affected. Fluctuations in our
results of operations may cause such results to fall below our financial
guidance or the expectations of analysts or investors, which could cause the
market price of our Class A common stock to decline.

The failure to attract new clients, the loss of clients, or a reduction in
spending by these clients could adversely affect our business, financial
condition, and results of operations.

A significant portion of our revenue is Software Platform Revenue and
Business Revenue from our Apps. Software Platform Revenue is mostly from
AppDiscovery, is generated from our advertisers, typically on a performance-
based, cost-per-install basis, then shared with our advertising publishers,
typically on a cost per impression model. Business Revenue generated from
our Apps comes from advertisers that purchase ad inventory from our diverse
portfolio of mobile games. As is common in the mobile app ecosystem and in
the advertising industry, our clients do not have long-term advertising
commitments with us. Our success depends in part on our ability to satisfy
our advertising partners.

Revenue could also be impacted by a number of other factors, including:

• our ability to attract and retain clients;

• our ability to improve the effectiveness and predictability of our
advertising and maintain and improve our machine-learning (ML) engine AXON;

• our ability to maintain or increase advertiser demand and third-party
publisher supply, the quantity, or quality of advertisements shown to users,
or our pricing of advertisements;

• our ability to continue to increase user access to and engagement with our
Apps;

• mobile app changes or inventory management decisions we may make that
change the size, format, frequency, or relative prominence of advertisements
displayed on our Apps;

• our ability to recruit, train, and retain personnel to support continued
growth of our Core Technologies and Software Platform;

• our ability to establish and maintain our brand and reputation;

• loss of market share to our competitors, including if competitors offer
lower priced, more integrated, or otherwise more effective products;

• the development and success of technologies designed to block the display
of advertisements or block our ad measurement tools, which have in the past
impacted and may in the future impact our business, or technologies that
make it easier for users to opt out of behavioral targeting;

• the availability, accuracy, utility, and security of analytics and
measurement solutions offered by us or third parties that demonstrate the
value of our Software Platform to advertisers, developers and publishers, or
our ability to further improve such tools;

• government actions or legislative, regulatory, or other legal developments
relating to advertising, including developments that may impact our ability
to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of advertising;

• changes that limit our ability to deliver, target, or measure the
effectiveness of advertising, including changes to policies by mobile
operating system and third-party platform providers, and the degree to which
users opt out of certain types of ad targeting as a result of changes and
controls implemented in connection with such policy changes and with the
E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (the "GDPR"), ePrivacy Directive,
the California Consumer Privacy Act (the "CCPA"), and the Children’s Online
Privacy Protection Act (the "COPPA");

• decisions by clients to reduce their advertising due to concerns about
legal liability or uncertainty regarding their own legal and compliance
obligations, or due to negative publicity, regardless of its accuracy,
involving us, our user data practices, advertising metrics or tools, our
Software Platform or Apps, or other companies in our industry; and

• the impact of macroeconomic conditions, including the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic and responses thereto, and seasonality, whether in the
advertising industry in general, or among specific types of advertisers or
within particular geographies.
                                     41                                     
Table of contents
From time to time, certain of these factors have adversely affected our
revenue to varying degrees. The occurrence of any of these or other factors
in the future could result in a reduction in demand for our Software
Platform and use of our Apps, which may reduce the prices we receive for our
advertisements or cause clients to stop advertising with us altogether,
either of which would adversely affect our business and results of
operations. The failure to attract new clients, loss of clients, or
reduction in spending by clients could adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.

Security breaches, improper access to or disclosure of our data or user
data, other hacking and phishing attacks on our systems, or other cyber
incidents could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business.

The mobile app ecosystem is prone to cyberattacks by third parties seeking
unauthorized access to our data or the data of our clients or users or to
disrupt our ability to provide service. Our Core Technologies, Software
Platform, Apps, and other offerings involve the collection, storage,
processing, and transmission of a large amount of data, including personal
information, and we and our third-party service providers otherwise store
and process information, including our confidential and proprietary business
information, and personal information and other information relating to our
employees and clients or other third parties. We also store and implement
measures designed to secure the source code for our Core Technologies,
Software Platform and Apps as they are created. Any failure to prevent or
mitigate security breaches or incidents impacting our systems or other
systems used in our business, or improper access to or disclosure of our
data, including source code, or user data, including personal information,
content, or payment information from users, or information from clients or
other third parties, that is stored or otherwise processed in our business
could result in the unauthorized loss, modification, disclosure,
destruction, or other misuse of such data, or unavailability of data or of
our Core Technologies, Software Platform, Apps, or other offerings. Any such
event, or the perception it has occurred, could adversely affect our
business and reputation, damage our operations, result in claims, litigation
or regulatory investigations or enforcement actions, fines, penalties, or
other liability or obligations, and diminish our competitive position. In
particular, a breach or incident, whether physical, electronic, or
otherwise, impacting systems on which source code or other sensitive data
are stored could lead to loss, disruption, unavailability, or piracy of, or
damage to, our offerings, lost or reduced ability to protect our
intellectual property, and diminished competitive position.

Computer malware (including ransomware), viruses, social engineering
(predominantly spear phishing attacks or credential stuffing), and general
hacking have become more prevalent in the mobile app ecosystem. Some of
these have occurred on our systems and otherwise in our business in the
past, and we expect will continue to occur in the future. We regularly
encounter attempts to create false or undesirable user accounts or take
other actions for purposes such as spamming or other objectionable ends. Any
actual or attempted breaches, incidents, or attacks may cause disruptions or
interruptions to our Core Technologies, Software Platform, Apps, or other
offerings, degrade the user experience, impair, disrupt, or interrupt our
internal systems and other systems and networks used in our business, or
adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, and results
of operations. Our efforts to protect our data, user data, and information
from clients, partners, and other third parties, and to disable or otherwise
respond to undesirable activities on our Core Technologies, Software
Platform, Apps, or other offerings, may also be unsuccessful due to software
bugs or other technical defects, errors, or malfunctions; employee,
contractor, vendor, or partner error or malfeasance, including defects or
vulnerabilities in information technology systems or offerings;
cyberattacks, attacks designed to disrupt systems or facilities, or breaches
of physical security of our facilities or technical infrastructure; or other
threats that evolve. Additionally, any such breach, incident, attack,
malfunction, defect, or vulnerability, or the perception that any of these
has occurred, may cause clients or users to lose confidence and trust in our
Core Technologies, Software Platform or Apps and otherwise harm our
reputation and market position.

In addition, some developers or other business partners, such as those that
help us measure the effectiveness of advertisements, may receive or store
information provided by us or by our users through mobile or web apps or
other means. These third parties may misappropriate our information and
engage in unauthorized use of it. If these third parties fail to adopt or
adhere to adequate data security practices, or experience a breach of, or
other security incident impacting, their networks or systems, our data or
our users’ data may be lost, destroyed, or improperly accessed, modified,
disclosed, or otherwise misused. In such an event, or if such an event is
perceived to have occurred, we may suffer damage to our reputation, may have
increased costs arising from the restoration or implementation of additional
security measures, and we may face claims, demands, investigations and other
proceedings by private parties or governmental actors, and fines, penalties,
and other liability or obligations, any of which could adversely affect our
business, financial condition, and results of operations. Any theft or
unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential
business information as a result of such an event could also adversely
affect our business, competitive position, and results of operations.
                                     42

Cyberattacks continue to evolve in sophistication and volume, and inherently
may be difficult to detect for long periods of time. Although we have
developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our data, user
data, and information from our partners; to prevent data loss, disable
undesirable accounts and activities on our Core Technologies, Software
Platform or Apps; and to prevent and detect security breaches; we cannot
assure you that such measures will provide comprehensive security, that we
will be able to identify breaches or other incidents or to react to them in
a timely manner or that our remediation efforts will be successful. We
experience cyberattacks and other security incidents of varying degrees from
time to time, and we may incur significant costs in investigating,
protecting against, litigating, or remediating such incidents. We may face
increased risks of cyberattacks and other security incidents during the
COVID-19 pandemic as a result of more employees working remotely, our use of
third-party systems designed to enable the transition to a remote workforce
introducing security risks and increased cyberattacks, such as phishing
attacks by threat actors using the attention placed on the COVID-19 pandemic
as a method for targeting personnel.

Additionally, our Core Technologies, Software Platform and other offerings
operate in conjunction with, and we are in some cases dependent upon, third-
party products, services, and components. Our ability to monitor our third-
party service providers’ data security is limited, and in any event,
attackers may be able to circumvent our third-party service providers’ data
security measures. There have been and may continue to be significant
attacks on certain third-party providers, and we cannot guarantee that our
or our third-party providers’ systems and networks have not been breached or
that they do not contain exploitable defects or bugs that could result in a
breach of or disruption to our systems and networks or the systems and
networks of third parties that support us and our platform and service. If
there is a security vulnerability, error, or other bug in one of these
third-party products, services, and components and if there is a security
exploit targeting them, we could face increased costs, claims, liability,
and additional or new obligations, reduced revenue, and harm to our
reputation or competitive position. We and our service providers may be
unable to anticipate these techniques, react, remediate or otherwise address
any security vulnerability, breach or other security incident in a timely
manner, or implement adequate preventative measures.

In addition to our efforts to mitigate cybersecurity risks, we are making
significant investments in privacy, safety, security, and content review
efforts to combat misuse of our services and user data by third parties. As
a result of these efforts, we anticipate that we will discover incidents of
misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties. We may
not discover all such incidents or activity, whether as a result of our data
limitations, the scale of activity on our Core Technologies and Software
Platform, challenges related to our personnel working remotely during the
COVID-19 pandemic, the re-allocation of resources to other projects, or
other factors, and we may be notified of such incidents or activity by
users, the media, or other third parties. Such incidents and activities have
in the past, and may in the future, include the use or other processing of
user data or our systems in a manner inconsistent with our terms, contracts
or policies, the existence of false or undesirable user accounts, improper
advertising practices, activities that threaten people’s safety on- or
offline or instances of spamming, scraping, data harvesting, or unsecured
datasets. We may also be unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our policies
or otherwise remediate or respond to any such incidents effectively or in a
timely manner. Any of the foregoing developments, or any reports of them
occurring or the perception that any of them has occurred, could adversely
affect user trust and engagement, harm our brand and reputation, require us
to change our business practices, result in claims, demands, investigations,
and other proceedings by private parties or governmental actors, and fines,
penalties, and other liability or obligations, and adversely affect our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and
abroad relating to cybersecurity and data protection, a number of which also
provide a private right of action. Affected users or government authorities
could initiate legal or regulatory actions against us in connection with any
actual or perceived security breaches or improper access to or disclosure of
data, which has occurred in the past and which could cause us to incur
significant expense and liability, distract management and technical
personnel, and result in orders or consent decrees forcing us to modify our
business practices. Such actual or perceived incidents or our efforts to
remediate such incidents may also result in a decline in our active user
base or engagement levels. We are seeing an increase in inquiries from our
partners regarding audit certifications, such as SOC 2, Type II, which we
have not yet achieved. Any of these events could adversely affect our
reputation, business, financial condition, or results of operations.

Our insurance coverage may not extend to all types of privacy and data
security breaches or other incidents, and it may be insufficient to cover
all costs and expenses associated with such incidents. Further, such
insurance may not continue to be available to us in the future on
economically reasonable terms, or at all, and insurers may deny us coverage
as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims
against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of
changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the
imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a
material adverse effect on our business, including our reputation, financial
condition, or results of operations.

The mobile app ecosystem is intensely competitive. If clients or users
prefer our competitors’ products or services over our own, our business,
financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.

We face significant competition in the mobile app ecosystem. We offer a
suite of solutions for developers to get their mobile apps discovered and
downloaded by the right users, optimize return on marketing spend, and
maximize the monetization of their engagement. We collect revenue from
clients for fees paid by mobile app advertisers, including developers, that
use our Software Platform and from the sale of advertising inventory of our
Apps. Advertisers often engage with several advertising platforms and
networks to purchase advertisements on mobile apps and developers often
engage with multiple tools to market and monetize their apps. Accordingly,
we face significant competition from traditional, online and mobile
businesses that provide ad networks and platforms, mobile apps and games,
media, and other services for advertisers to reach relevant audiences. We
also face competition from providers of developer tools that enable
developers to reach their audiences or manage or optimize their advertising
campaigns. These companies vary in size and include Facebook, Google, and
Unity Software as well as various private companies. Several of these
companies, including Facebook, Google, and Unity Software, are also our
partners and clients. Additionally, our studios build many of our Apps using
the development kits offered by Unity Software. Clients who are also
competitors may decide to invest in their own offerings rather than continue
to use our Software Platform or advertise on our Apps.

Additionally, we also compete with businesses that develop online and mobile
games and other mobile apps, which vary in size and include companies such
as Activision Blizzard (expected to be acquired by Microsoft), Tencent, and
Zynga (expected to be acquired by Take-Two Interactive), as well as other
public and private companies. Many of these companies are also our partners
and clients. As we expand our global operations and mobile app offerings, we
increasingly face competition from high-profile companies with significant
online presences that may introduce new or expanded offerings, such as
Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Snap. In addition, other large
companies that to date have not actively focused on mobile apps or gaming
may decide to develop mobile apps or gaming offerings, such as Amazon’s
recently introduced games platform, or partner with other developers. Some
of these current and potential competitors have significantly greater
resources that can be used to develop, acquire, or brand additional mobile
apps or gaming alternatives, and may have more diversified revenue sources
than we do and therefore may be less severely affected by changes in
consumer preferences, regulations, or other developments that may impact our
business or industry.

Further, as there are relatively low barriers to entry to develop and
publish a mobile app, we expect new competitors to enter the market and
existing competitors to allocate more resources towards developing and
marketing competing games and apps. Because our mobile games are free-to-
play, our Apps compete primarily on the basis of user experience rather than
price. The proliferation of apps makes it difficult for us to differentiate
ourselves from our competitors and compete for users and the success of our
Apps will depend in part on our Software Platform continuing to provide
effective marketing and monetization tools.

We also face competition for advertising spending and for the discretionary
spending, leisure time, and attention of our users from game platforms such
as personal computer and console games, and other leisure time activities,
such as television, movies, music, sports, and the internet. In addition,
non-game applications for mobile devices, such as social media and
messaging, television, movies, music, dating, and sports, have become
increasingly popular, making the overall mobile app ecosystem highly
fragmented and making it more difficult for any mobile app to differentiate
itself. To the extent we explore new business opportunities in the mobile
app ecosystem or otherwise, we may also compete with established businesses
with more experience in such areas. Our future growth depends in part on the
overall health of the mobile app ecosystem and in particular, mobile gaming.
Increasing competition could result in decreases in our App users, increased
user acquisition costs, lower engagement with our Apps, and loss of key
personnel, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial
condition, or results of operations.

Some of our current and potential competitors may be domiciled in different
countries and subject to political, legal, and regulatory regimes that
enable them to compete more effectively than us, particularly outside of the
United States. Some of our current and potential competitors may have
greater resources, more diversified revenue streams, better technological or
data analytics capabilities, or stronger brands or competitive positions in
certain product segments, geographic regions, or user demographics than we
do. If clients or users prefer our competitors’ products or services over
our own, or if our competitors are better able to adapt to changes in the
preferences of advertisers or users, regulations, or other developments, our
business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely
affected.

The mobile app ecosystem is subject to rapid technological change, and if we
do not adapt to, and appropriately allocate our resources among, emerging
technologies and business models, our business, financial condition, and
results of operations could be adversely affected.

Technology changes rapidly in the mobile app ecosystem. Our future success
depends in part on our ability to adapt to trends and to innovate. To
attract new clients and users and increase revenue from our current clients
and users, we will need to enhance and improve our Core Technologies,
Software Platform, and Apps. Enhancements of our existing technology and
offerings, and new offerings, may not be introduced in a timely or cost-
effective manner and may contain errors or defects.

Our business also currently depends in part on the growth and evolution of
the internet, especially mobile internet-enabled devices. The number of
people using mobile internet-enabled devices has increased rapidly over
time, and we expect that this trend will continue. However, the mobile app
ecosystem may not grow in the way we anticipate. We must continually
anticipate and adapt to emerging technologies to stay competitive. As the
technological infrastructure for internet access improves and evolves,
consumers will be presented with more opportunities to access apps and play
games on a variety of devices and platforms and to experience other leisure
activities that may compete with mobile apps. Forecasting the financial
impact of these emerging technologies and business models is inherently
uncertain and volatile. If we decide to support a new technology or business
model in the future, it may require partnering with a new platform,
technology, or business partner, which may be on terms that are less
favorable to us than those for traditional technologies or business models.

To invest in a new technology or expand our offerings, we must invest
financial resources and management attention. We may invest significant
resources in a new offering or in a strategic acquisition or partnership,
which could prove unsuccessful or prevent us from directing these resources
towards other opportunities. We may never recover the often-substantial up-
front costs of developing and marketing emerging technologies or business
models, or recover the opportunity cost of diverting management and
financial resources. Further, our competitors may adopt an emerging
technology or business model more quickly or effectively than we do,
creating products that are technologically superior to ours or attract more
users than ours.

If, on the other hand, we do not continue to enhance our Core Technologies,
Software Platform, or Apps, or do not appropriately allocate our resources
amongst opportunities, or we otherwise elect not to pursue new business
models that achieve significant commercial success, we may face adverse
consequences. For example, we do not currently offer our Apps on all devices
or all gaming platforms. If the devices on which our Apps are available
decline in popularity or become obsolete faster than anticipated, or if new
platforms emerge other than those on which our games are offered, we could
experience a decline in revenue and in our number of App users, and we may
not achieve the anticipated return on our development efforts. It may take
significant time and expenditures to shift product development resources to
new technologies, and it may be more difficult to compete against existing
products incorporating such technologies. If new technologies render mobile
devices obsolete or we are unable to successfully adapt to and appropriately
allocate our resources amongst current and new technologies, our business,
financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Our Core Technologies, Software Platform and Apps, as well as our internal
systems, rely on software and hardware that is highly technical, and any
errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities in these systems, or failures to address or
mitigate technical limitations in our systems, could adversely affect our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Our Core Technologies, Software Platform and Apps, as well as our internal
systems, rely on software and hardware that is highly technical and complex.
In addition, our Core Technologies, Software Platform and Apps, as well as
our internal systems, depend in part on the ability of such software and
hardware to store, retrieve, process, and manage immense amounts of data.
The software and hardware on which we rely has contained, and will in the
future contain, errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities and our systems are subject
to certain technical limitations that may compromise our ability to meet our
objectives. Some errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities inherently may be
difficult to detect and may only be discovered after the code has been
released for external or internal use. Errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, design
defects, or technical limitations within the software and hardware on which
we rely have in the past led to, and may in the future lead to, outcomes
including a negative experience for clients and users who use our offerings,
compromised ability of our offerings to perform in a manner consistent with
our terms, contracts, or policies, delayed product or App launches or
enhancements, targeting, measurement, or billing errors, compromised ability
to protect the data of our users and/or our intellectual property, or
reductions in our ability to provide some or all of our services. To the
extent such errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, or defects impact our Core
Technologies or Software Platform or the accuracy of data in any such Core
Technology or Software Platform, our clients may become dissatisfied with
our offerings, our brand and reputation may be harmed, and we may make
operational
                                     45

decisions, such as with respect to our Apps using such Software Platform or
any future strategic acquisition, that are based on inaccurate data. Any
errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, or defects in our systems or the software and
hardware on which we rely, failures to properly address or mitigate the
technical limitations in our systems, or associated degradations or
interruptions of service or failures to fulfill our commitments to our
clients may lead to outcomes including damage to our reputation, increased
product engineering expenses, regulatory inquiries, litigation, or liability
for fines, damages, or other remedies, any of which could adversely affect
our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Our business depends in part on our ability to maintain and scale our
technical infrastructure, and any significant disruption to our Core
Technologies, Software Platform or Apps could damage our reputation, result
in a potential loss of engagement, and adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.

Our reputation and ability to attract and retain our clients and users
depends in part on the reliable performance of our Core Technologies,
Software Platform and Apps. We have in the past experienced, and may in the
future experience, interruptions in the availability or performance of our
offerings from time to time. Our systems may not be adequately designed or
may not operate with the reliability and redundancy necessary to avoid
performance delays or outages that could be harmful to our business. If our
offerings are unavailable when users attempt to access them, or if they do
not load as quickly as expected, users may not use our offerings as often in
the future, or at all, which could adversely affect our business and results
of operations. As we continue to grow, we will need an increasing amount of
technical infrastructure, including network capacity and computing power, to
continue to satisfy our needs and the needs of our clients and users. It is
possible that we may fail to continue to effectively scale and grow our
technical infrastructure to accommodate these increased demands, which may
adversely affect our user engagement and revenue growth. Additionally, we
rely in part on third-party data centers and cloud hosting infrastructure.
Our business may be subject to interruptions, delays, or failures resulting
from natural disasters and other events outside of our control that impact
us or these third-party providers. If such an event were to occur, users may
be subject to service disruptions or outages and we may not be able to
recover our technical infrastructure and user data in a timely manner to
restart or provide our services. If we fail to efficiently scale and manage
our infrastructure, or if events disrupt our infrastructure or those of our
third-party providers, our business, financial condition, and results of
operations could be adversely affected.

We are highly dependent on our co-founder and chief executive officer, as
well as our senior management team, and our business and growth may be
adversely affected if we fail to attract, retain, and motivate key
personnel.

Our future success depends in significant part on the continued service of
our key management and engineering personnel, including our co-founder, CEO,
and Chairperson, Adam Foroughi. Our ability to compete and grow depends in
part on the efforts and talents of these employees and executives, who are
important to our vision, strategic direction, culture, products, and
technology. We do not have employment agreements, other than offer letters,
with Mr. Foroughi or other members of our senior management team, and we do
not maintain key-man insurance for members of our senior management team.
The loss of Mr. Foroughi or any other member of our senior management team
could cause disruption and adversely affect our business, financial
condition, or results of operations.

In addition, our ability to execute our strategy depends in part on our
continued ability and the continued ability of our Partner Studios to
identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly skilled employees,
particularly in the competitive fields of game development, product
management, engineering, and data science. We believe that our corporate
culture has been an important factor in our ability to hire and retain key
employees, and if we are unable to maintain our corporate culture as we
grow, we may be unable to foster the innovation, creativity, and teamwork we
believe we need to support our growth. While we believe we compete
favorably, competition for highly skilled employees is intense, particularly
in the San Francisco Bay Area, where our headquarters is located.
Interviewing, hiring, and integrating new employees has been and will
continue to be particularly challenging during the COVID-19 pandemic. As
part of our global remote working plans, throughout the duration of the
COVID-19 pandemic, we have and will continue to devote increased efforts to
maintaining our collaborative culture, including through the use of
videoconferencing and other online communication and sharing tools, and to
monitoring the health, safety, morale, and productivity of our employees,
including new employees, as we evaluate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic
on our business and employees. If we are unable to identify, hire, and
retain highly skilled employees, our business, financial condition, and
results of operations could be adversely affected.

We have historically hired a number of key personnel and added additional
team members working on our Apps through strategic acquisitions and
partnerships, and as competition within the mobile app ecosystem for
                                     46

attractive target companies with a skilled employee base persists and
increases, we may incur significant expenses and difficulty in continuing
this practice. The loss of talented employees with experience in the assets
we acquire could result in significant disruptions to our business and the
integration of acquired assets and businesses. If we do not succeed in
recruiting, retaining, and motivating these key employees, we may not
achieve the anticipated results of acquisitions.

We have experienced significant growth through strategic acquisitions and
partnerships, and we face risks related to the integration of such
acquisitions and the management of such growth.

As part of our growth strategy, we have frequently acquired companies,
businesses, personnel, and technologies in the past, and we intend to
continue to evaluate and pursue strategic acquisitions and partnerships. For
example, we acquired PeopleFun, Inc. in the first quarter of 2018, MAX
Advertising Systems, Inc. in the third quarter of 2018, SafeDK Mobile Ltd.
in July 2019, Machine Zone, Inc. (Machine Zone) in May 2020, adjust GmbH
(Adjust) in April 2021, and the MoPub business in January 2022. In February
2022, we also entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Wurl, Inc. Each
acquisition requires unique approaches to integration due to, among other
reasons, the structure of the acquisition, the size, locations, and cultural
differences among their team and ours, and has required, and will continue
to require, attention from our management team. As we continue to grow, the
size of our acquisitions and investments may increase. For instance, our
acquisitions of Machine Zone, Adjust, and the MoPub business were our
largest acquisitions to date. In addition to the larger purchase prices
associated with such acquisitions and investments, larger acquisitions and
investments may also require additional management resources to integrate
more significant and often more complex businesses into our company. We will
continue to explore and evaluate additional acquisitions, some of which may
be the same size or even larger in scale and investment than the Machine
Zone, Adjust, and the MoPub acquisitions.

Our future success depends in part on our ability to integrate these
acquisitions and manage these businesses, partnerships, and transactions
effectively. If we are unable to obtain the anticipated benefits or
synergies of such acquisitions, or we encounter difficulties integrating
acquired businesses with ours, our business, financial condition, and
results of operations could be adversely affected.

Challenges and risks from such strategic acquisitions and partnerships
include:

• diversion of our management’s attention in the acquisition and integration
process, including oversight over acquired businesses which continue their
operations under contingent consideration provisions in acquisition
agreements;

• declining employee morale and retention issues resulting from changes in
compensation, or changes in management, reporting relationships, or future
performance;

• the need to integrate the operations, systems, technologies, products, and
personnel of each acquired company, the inefficiencies and lack of control
that may result if such integration is delayed or not implemented, and
unforeseen difficulties and expenditures that may arise in connection with
integration;

• costs associated with onboarding clients of an acquired business;

• the need to implement internal controls, procedures, and policies
appropriate for a larger, U.S.-based public company at companies that prior
to acquisition may not have as robust controls, procedures, and policies, in
particular, with respect to the effectiveness of internal controls, cyber
and information security practices and incident response plans, compliance
with privacy, data protection, and other regulations protecting the rights
of clients and users, and compliance with U.S.-based economic policies and
sanctions which may not have previously been applicable to the acquired
company’s operations;

• the difficulty in accurately forecasting and accounting for the financial
impact of an acquisition transaction, including accounting charges, write-
offs of deferred revenue under purchase accounting, and integrating and
reporting results for acquired companies that have not historically followed
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP");

• the implementation of restructuring actions and cost reduction initiatives
to streamline operations and improve cost efficiencies;

• the fact that we may be required to pay contingent consideration in excess
of the initial fair value, and contingent consideration may become payable
at a time when we do not have sufficient cash available to pay such
consideration;
                                     47                                     
Table of contents
• in the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations
across different cultures and languages and to address the particular
economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific
countries as well as tax risks that may arise from the acquisition;

• increasing legal, regulatory, and compliance exposure, and the additional
costs related to mitigate each of those, as a result of adding new offices,
employees and other service providers, benefit plans, equity, job types, and
lines of business globally; and

• liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition,
including intellectual property, commercial, and other litigation claims or
disputes, cyber and information security vulnerabilities, violations of
laws, rules and regulations, including with respect to employee
classification, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities.

If we are unable to successfully integrate and manage our acquisitions and
strategic partnerships, we may not realize the expected benefits of such
transactions or become exposed to additional liabilities, and our business,
financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.

We plan to continue to expand and diversify our operations through strategic
acquisitions and partnerships. We face a number of risks related to these
transactions.

We plan to continue to expand and diversify our operations with additional
strategic acquisitions or partnerships, strategic collaborations, joint
ventures, or licensing arrangements. As we continue to grow, these
transactions may be larger and require significant investments, such as our
acquisitions of Machine Zone, Adjust, MoPub and Wurl. We may be unable to
identify or complete prospective acquisitions or partnerships for many
reasons, including our ability to identify suitable targets, increasing
competition from other potential acquirers, the effects of consolidation in
our industries, potentially high valuations of acquisition candidates, and
the availability of financing to complete larger acquisitions. Even if we do
complete any such transactions, we may incur significant costs, such as
professional service fees or publisher bonuses. In addition, applicable
antitrust laws and other regulations may limit our ability to acquire
targets, particularly larger targets, or force us to divest an acquired
business. If we are unable to identify suitable targets or complete
acquisitions, our growth prospects could be adversely affected, and we may
not be able to realize sufficient scale and technological advantages to
compete effectively in all markets.

Further, completing larger acquisitions or other strategic transactions is
significantly riskier in that such transactions require additional
consideration and management attention to complete, and could introduce
additional exposure to regulatory and compliance risk. To complete these
transactions, we may need to spend large amounts of cash, which may not be
available to us on acceptable terms, if at all, or issue equity or equity-
linked consideration, which may dilute our current stockholders. For
example, in connection with our acquisition of Adjust in April 2021, we
issued convertible securities that converted into an aggregate of 6,320,688
shares of our Class A common stock. Further, we generally devote more time
and resources towards performing diligence on larger transactions and may be
required to devote more resources towards regulatory requirements in
connection with such transactions. To the extent that we do not perform
sufficient diligence on a larger acquisition or such a transaction does not
generate the expected benefits, our business, financial condition, and
results of operations will be harmed, and to a greater extent than would
occur with a smaller transaction.

Absent such strategic transactions, we would need to undertake additional
development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect
to fund and undertake such additional efforts on our own, we may need to
obtain additional expertise and additional capital, which may not be
available to our company on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to
do any of the foregoing, we may not be able to develop our Core
Technologies, Software Platform, and Apps effectively or achieve our
expected product roadmap on a timely basis, which could adversely affect our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.

The benefits of a strategic acquisition or partnership may also take
considerable time to develop, and we cannot be certain that any particular
strategic acquisition or partnership will produce the intended benefits.
Further, acquisitions could result in potential dilutive issuances of equity
securities, use of significant cash balances or incurrence of debt (and
increased interest expense), contingent liabilities or amortization expenses
related to intangible assets, or write-offs of goodwill and intangible
assets. If we are unable to identify and complete strategic acquisitions or
partnerships, our business, financial condition, and results of operations
could be adversely affected.

Our strategic review of our Apps portfolio may not result in improvements to
our financial performance, strategy, or operations, and we face a number of
risks related to such review.
                                     48                                     
Table of contents
We are currently undertaking a strategic review of our Apps portfolio and
its cost structure, focusing on how best to optimize each asset’s
contribution to our overall financial performance. This review may result in
the divestiture of certain studios or other assets, or other changes to our
Apps portfolio, such as restructuring of certain assets or choosing to make
changes to optimize the cost structure of certain Apps rather than investing
in revenue growth. We may not achieve the desired strategic, operational and
financial benefits of any divestiture or other strategic transaction, or any
other action taken as a result of our strategic review. Further, we may not
be able to successfully execute the desired changes. During the pendency of
this review or any transaction that may occur as a result of this review, we
may be subject to risks related to a decline in the business or employee
morale and turnover, as well as distraction of management from our business
and customers, and investors may not react favorably to our decisions, which
could adversely affect our business, results of operations and the market
price of our Class A common stock. If we are unable to successfully complete
our strategic review or we are unable to complete the proposed outcomes of
this review or they do not meet our strategic objectives, our business,
results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.

Our strategic acquisitions and partnerships may expose us to tax risks.

From time to time, we have acquired and may acquire companies, assets,
businesses, and technologies and we have entered into and may enter into
other strategic partnerships and transactions. We face a variety of tax
risks related to such transactions, including that we may be required to
make tax withholdings in various jurisdictions in connection with such
transactions or as part of our continuing operations following a
transaction, and that the companies or businesses we acquire may cause us to
alter our international tax structure or otherwise create more complexity
with respect to tax matters. Additionally, while we typically include
indemnification provisions in our definitive agreements related to strategic
acquisitions and partnerships, these indemnification provisions may be
insufficient in the event that tax liabilities are greater than expected or
in areas that are not fully covered by indemnification. If we are unable to
adequately predict and address such tax issues as they arise, our business,
financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.

We have entered into strategic partnerships with mobile gaming studios, and
a failure to maintain such relationships may harm our ability to launch new
Apps as well as our brand and reputation.

From time to time, we have entered into strategic partnerships with mobile
gaming studios (our Partner Studios). We have historically allowed these
Partner Studios to continue their operations with a degree of autonomy. In
certain of these transactions, we have bought games from such Partner
Studios and entered into development agreements whereby such Partner Studios
provide us support in developing and improving games and grant us a right of
first refusal with respect to future games. These agreements typically have
a fixed term, after which our Partner Studios may choose not to continue
working with us. Any deterioration in our relationship with these Partner
Studios may harm our ability to monetize the games we purchase and launch
future mobile games developed by these Partner Studios and may lead to such
Partner Studios choosing not to renew their partnerships with us. Further,
if a Partner Studio becomes dissatisfied with us, our brand and reputation
may be harmed and we may have more difficulty entering into similar
partnerships in the future. Additionally, our international Partner Studios
may be located in areas with less certain legal and regulatory regimes or
more potential risks, which may increase our costs to maintain such
strategic partnership. If we are unable to maintain any of these
partnerships, we may be required to invest significant resources in
expanding our other studios or entering into agreements with additional
mobile gaming studios in order to continue producing the same volume and
quality of Apps, and our business, financial condition, and results of
operations could be adversely affected.

We rely on third-party platforms to distribute our Apps and collect revenue,
and if our ability to do so is harmed, or such third-party platforms change
their policies in such a way that restricts our business, increases our
expenses, or limits the information we derive from our Apps, our business,
financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.

The mobile app ecosystem depends in part on a relatively small number of
third-party distribution platforms, such as the Apple App Store, the Google
Play Store, and Facebook, some of which are direct competitors. We derive
significant revenue from the distribution of our Apps through these third-
party platforms and almost all of our IAPs are made through the payment
processing systems of these third-party platforms. We are subject to the
standard policies and terms of service of such third-party platforms, which
generally govern the promotion, distribution, content, and operation of
applications on such platforms. Each platform provider has broad discretion
to change and interpret its terms of service and other policies with respect
to us and other mobile app companies, and those changes may be unfavorable
to us. A platform provider may also change its fee structure, add fees
associated with access to and use of its platform, alter how mobile apps are
labeled or are able to advertise on its platform, change how the personal
information of its users is made available to developers on its platform,
limit the use of
                                     49                                     
Table of contents
personal information for advertising purposes, restrict how users can share
information on its platform or across platforms, or significantly increase
the level of compliance or requirements necessary to use its platform. For
example, in April 2021, Apple started implementing its application tracking
transparency framework that, among other things, requires users' opt-in
consent for certain types of tracking. While this transparency framework has
not had a significant impact on our overall business, it may in the future
continue to have an impact on it, including the effectiveness of our
advertising practices and/or our ability to efficiently generate revenue for
our Apps. We rely in part on IDFA to provide us with data that helps our
Software Platform better market and monetize Apps. The IDFA and transparency
changes may require us to engage in significant changes to our data
collection practices, which may require our expenditure of substantial costs
and resources, and to the extent we are unable to utilize IDFA or a similar
offering, or if the transparency changes and any related opt-in or other
requirements result in decreases in the availability or utility of data
relating to Apps, our Software Platform may not be as effective, we may not
be able to continue to efficiently generate revenue for our Apps, and our
revenue and results of operations may be harmed. Additionally, Apple
implemented new requirements for consumer disclosures regarding privacy and
data processing practices in December 2020, which has resulted in increased
compliance requirements and could result in decreased usage of our Apps. In
February 2022, Google announced it planned to adopt restrictions to restrict
tracking activity across Android devices. These or any similar changes to
the policies of Apple or Google may materially and adversely affect our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.

If we violate, or a distribution platform provider believes we have
violated, a distribution platform’s terms of service, or if there is any
change or deterioration in our relationship with such distribution provider,
that platform provider could limit or discontinue our access to its
platform. For example, in August 2020, Apple and Google removed a mobile
game developed by one of our competitors from their platforms for violating
their standard policies and terms of service. If one of our distribution
platform partners were to limit or discontinue the distribution of our Apps
on their platform, it could adversely affect our business, financial
condition, and results of operations.

We also rely on the continued popularity, user adoption, and functionality
of third-party platforms. In the past, some of these platform providers have
been unavailable for short periods of time or experienced issues with their
in-app purchasing functionality. In addition, third-party platforms also
impose certain file size limitations, which may limit the ability of users
to download some of our larger Apps in over-the-air updates. Aside from
these over-the-air file size limitations, a larger game file size could
cause users to delete our mobile games once the file size grows beyond the
capacity of their devices’ storage limitations or could reduce the number of
downloads of these mobile games.

If issues arise with third-party platforms that impact the visibility or
availability of our Apps, our users’ ability to access our Apps or our
ability to monetize our Apps, or otherwise impact the design or
effectiveness of our Software Platform, our business, financial condition,
and results of operations could be adversely affected.

If we are unable to launch or acquire new Apps and successfully monetize
them, or continue to improve the experience and monetization of our existing
Apps, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be
adversely affected.

Our Apps portfolio depends in part on launching or acquiring, and continuing
to service, mobile apps that users will download and spend time and money
using. We have devoted and we may in the future continue to devote
substantial resources to the research, development, analytics, and marketing
of our Apps. Our development and marketing efforts are focused on improving
the experience of our existing Apps, developing new Apps, and successfully
monetizing our Apps. Our Apps generate revenue primarily through the sale of
advertising, a substantial portion of which comes from other mobile gaming
clients, and in-app purchases (IAPs). For Apps distributed through third-
party platforms, we are required to share a portion of the proceeds from in-
game sales with the platform providers, which share may be subject to
changes or increases over time. In order to achieve and maintain our
profitability, we need to generate sufficient revenue from our existing and
new Apps to offset our ongoing development, marketing, and other operating
expenses.

Successfully monetizing our Apps is difficult and requires that we deliver
user experiences that a sufficient number of users will pay for through IAPs
or we are able to otherwise sufficiently monetize our Apps, including by
serving in-app advertising. The success of our Apps depends in part on
unpredictable and volatile factors beyond our control including user
preferences, competing apps, new third-party platforms, and the availability
of other entertainment experiences. If our Apps do not meet user
expectations or if they are not brought to market in a timely and effective
manner, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.

In addition, our ability to successfully launch or acquire Apps and their
ability to achieve commercial success will depend in part on our ability to:
                                     50                                     
Table of contents
• effectively market our Apps to existing and new users;

• achieve a positive return on investment from our marketing and user
acquisition costs or achieve organic user growth;

• adapt to changing trends, user preferences, new technologies, and new
feature sets for mobile and other devices, including determining whether to
invest in development for any new technologies, and achieve a positive
return on the costs associated with such adaptation;

• continue to adapt mobile app feature sets for an increasingly diverse set
of mobile devices, including various operating systems and specifications,
limited bandwidth, and varying processing power and screen sizes;

• achieve and maintain successful user engagement and effectively monetize
our Apps;

• develop mobile games that can build upon or become franchise games and
expand and enhance our mobile games after their initial releases;

• develop Apps other than mobile games;

• identify and execute strategic acquisitions and partnerships;

• attract advertisers to advertise on our Apps;

• partner with third-party platforms and obtain featuring opportunities;

• compete successfully against a large and growing number of competitors;

• accurately forecast the timing and expense of our operations, including
mobile app and feature development, marketing, and user acquisition;

• minimize and quickly resolve bugs or outages;

• acquire, or invest in, and successfully integrate high quality mobile app
companies or technologies; and

• retain and motivate talented and experienced developers and other key
personnel from such acquisitions and investments.

These and other uncertainties make it difficult to know whether we will
succeed in continuing to develop and launch new Apps. Even if successful,
certain genres of mobile apps, such as casual games, may have a relatively
short lifespan. Further, as our Apps expand into additional genres of mobile
games or additional categories of mobile apps, we will face risks as well as
market, legal and regulatory challenges specific to those genres or
categories. For example, in mid-core games, there is typically a higher
upfront investment prior to the launch of a game compared to casual games,
which means publishing a new game in that genre will expose us to greater
risks as our financial condition and results of operations will be more
significantly adversely affected to the extent such a game does not become
popular and commercially successful. If we are not successful in launching
new mobile games or expanding into other genres of mobile games or
categories of mobile apps, our business, financial condition, and results of
operations could be adversely affected.
If we fail to retain existing users or add new users cost-effectively, or if
our users decrease their level of engagement with Apps, our business,
financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.
The size of our user base and the level of user engagement with our Apps are
critical to our success. Our results of operations have been and will
continue to be significantly determined by our success in acquiring and
engaging App users. We expect that the number of our App users may fluctuate
or decline in one or more markets from time to time, particularly in markets
where we have achieved higher penetration rates. In addition, if people do
not perceive our Apps as useful or entertaining, we may not be able to
attract or retain users or otherwise maintain or increase the frequency and
duration of their engagement, which could harm our revenue. A number of
mobile apps that achieved early popularity have since seen their user bases
or user engagement levels decline. There is no guarantee that we will not
experience a similar erosion of our App users or user engagement levels. Our
user engagement patterns have changed over time, and user engagement can be
difficult to measure, particularly as we introduce new and different Apps.
Any number of factors can adversely affect user growth and engagement,
including if:

• users increasingly engage with mobile apps offered by competitors or
mobile apps in categories other than those of our Apps;
                                     51                                     
Table of contents
• we fail to introduce new Apps or features that users find engaging or that
achieve a high level of market acceptance or we introduce new Apps, or make
changes to existing Apps that are not favorably received;

• users feel that their experience is diminished as a result of the
decisions we make with respect to the frequency, prominence, format, size,
and quality of advertisements that we display;

• users have difficulty installing, updating, or otherwise accessing our
Apps as a result of actions by us or third parties;

• we are unable to continue to develop Apps that work with a variety of
mobile operating systems and networks; and

• questions about the quality of our Apps, our data practices or concerns
related to privacy and sharing of personal information and other user data,
safety, security, or other factors.

Additionally, we expect it will become increasingly difficult and more
expensive for us to acquire users for our Apps for a variety of reasons,
including the increasingly competitive nature of the mobile app ecosystem
and the significant amount of time and attention users are dedicating to
competing entertainment options. Further, we believe that changes that Apple
has implemented during the last several years to its platform, particularly
the removal of the Top Grossing rankings and decreasing the prominence of
the Top Free rankings as well as transparency and IDFA changes, may
adversely affect the number of organic downloads of our Apps. If our
competitors increase their user acquisition spending, we could experience
higher costs per an install for our Apps, which would adversely affect our
revenue and margins. Furthermore, our spending on user acquisition is based
on certain assumptions about their projected behavior, particularly for new
Apps for which we do not have similar Apps in our portfolio to aid us in our
modeling efforts. If we are unable to grow our user base and increase our
user engagement levels, or unable to do so cost effectively, our business,
financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Our revenue has been concentrated in various ways and the loss of, or a
significant reduction in, any such revenue source, or our failure to
successfully expand and diversify our revenue sources could adversely affect
our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We have historically experienced revenue concentration with respect to
certain Apps as well as other facets of our business. Our future success
depends, in part, on launching or acquiring and successfully monetizing
additional Apps and on establishing and maintaining successful relationships
with a diverse set of clients. While our Apps consist of over 350 mobile
games, currently a limited number of those are responsible for a significant
portion of our revenue. I n the three months ended March 31, 2022, three
games, Project Makeover, Matchington Mansion and Wordscapes, collectively
represented approximately 26% of our revenue. The loss or failure to
successfully monetize one of these Apps could have a significant impact on
our results of operations. Similarly, our future success depends, in part,
on the ability of our Owned Studios and Partner Studios to launch and
monetize additional mobile games and other mobile apps, as well as, on our
ability to successfully acquire and monetize additional mobile games and
other mobile apps, and these Apps may not successfully diversify our revenue
concentration. If we are unable to successfully launch or acquire new Apps,
our reliance on a limited number of Apps may increase. Additionally, certain
genres of games typically rely on only a small portion of their total users
for a significant amount of their revenue, and as we expand our number of
Apps in these genres, such as mid-core, we may experience these effects and
need to attract, engage, and increase the spending levels of these
particular users to achieve success.

More generally, we face concentration risk in that our Software Platform and
Apps operate in the mobile app ecosystem and specifically mobile gaming. As
such, our business depends, in part, on the continued health and growth of
these app ecosystems. Further, a significant amount of our total revenue is
derived through a limited number of third-party distribution platforms, such
as the Apple App Store, the Google Play Store, and Facebook. Because
Facebook and Google are also significant partners of Adjust, a deterioration
in our or Adjust’s relationship with such companies would have a greater
impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. If
any of these concentrated portions of our revenue are harmed or are lost,
our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be
adversely affected.
We have experienced recent rapid growth, which may not be indicative of our
future growth. We may be unable to effectively manage the growth of our
business, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition,
and results of operations.
                                     52                                     
Table of contents
We have experienced rapid growth in the scale, scope, and complexity of our
business. For example, our Software Platform revenue has expanded rapidly,
in particular since the launch of our ML-engine AXON. Our growth in any
prior period should not be relied upon as an indication of our future
performance, as we may not be able to sustain our growth rate in the future.
Even if our revenue continues to increase, we expect that our revenue growth
rate may decline in the future as a result of a variety of factors,
including because of more difficult comparisons to prior periods and the
saturation of the market. The overall growth of our revenue depends in part
on our ability to execute on our growth strategies.

Additionally, the growth and expansion of our business has placed and
continues to place a significant strain on our management, operations,
financial infrastructure, and corporate culture. Our future success depends
in part on our ability to manage this expanded business. If not managed
effectively, this growth could result in the over-extension of our
management systems and information technology systems and our internal
controls and procedures may not be adequate to support this growth. Failure
to adequately manage our growth in any of these ways may cause damage to our
brand and reputation and adversely affect our business, financial condition,
and results of operations.
Our future growth may involve expansion into new business opportunities, and
any efforts to do so that are unsuccessful or are not cost-effective could
adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.
In the past, we have grown by expanding our offerings into new business
opportunities and we expect to continue to do so. We have dedicated
resources to expanding into adjacent business opportunities in which large
competitors have an established presence, as was the case with our Apps.
Additionally, our future growth may include expansion into additional genres
of mobile games, other mobile app sectors, connected TV markets, blockchain-
related markets or other opportunities which may require significant
investment in order to launch and which may not be prove successful.
Further, any such expansion may subject us to new or additional laws and
regulations, compliance with which may be burdensome and costly. Our future
growth depends in part on our ability to correctly identify areas of
investment and to cost-effectively execute on our plans. We have in the past
and may in the future expend significant resources in connection with
strategic acquisitions and partnerships to expand into new business
opportunities. Even if successful, the growth of any new business
opportunity could create significant challenges for our management and
operational resources and could require considerable investment. The
deployment of significant resources towards a new opportunity that proves
unsuccessful, or our inability to choose the correct investment
opportunities for our future, could adversely affect our business, financial
condition, and results of operations.

Our international operations are subject to increased challenges and risks.

We expect to continue to expand our international operations in the future
by opening new offices, entering into strategic partnerships with new
international game studios, acquiring companies that may have international
operations, and providing our Apps in additional countries and languages.
For example, our Owned Studios and Partner Studios are located throughout
the world, including in areas with less certain legal and regulatory regimes
or more potential risks, such as Belarus, China and Vietnam and with
operations in Russia and Ukraine. Expanding our international operations may
subject us to risks associated with:

• recruiting and retaining talented and capable management and employees in
foreign countries;

• the diversion of senior management attention;

• challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences;

• developing and customizing Software Platform and Apps that appeal to the
tastes and preferences of users in international markets;

• the inability to offer certain Software Platform or Apps in certain
foreign countries;

• competition from local mobile app developers with intellectual property
rights and significant market share in those markets and with a better
understanding of user preferences;

• utilizing, protecting, defending, and enforcing our intellectual property
rights;

• negotiating agreements with local distribution platforms that are
sufficiently economically beneficial to us and protective of our rights;

• the inability to extend proprietary rights in our brand, content, or
technology into new jurisdictions;
                                     53                                     
Table of contents
• implementing alternative payment methods for features and virtual goods in
a manner that complies with local laws and practices and protects us from
fraud;

• compliance with applicable foreign laws and regulations, including anti-
bribery laws, privacy laws, and laws relating to content and consumer
protection (for example, the United Kingdom’s Office of Fair Trading’s 2014
principles relating to IAPs in free-to-play games that are directed toward
children 16 and under);

• credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud;

• currency exchange rate fluctuations;

• protectionist laws and business practices that favor local businesses in
certain countries;

• double taxation of our international earnings and potentially adverse tax
consequences due to changes in the tax laws in the United States or the
foreign jurisdictions in which we operate;

• political, economic, and social instability, such as the conflict in
Ukraine and its impacts on the region and the regional and global economy;

• public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which can result in
varying impacts to our employees, clients, users, advertisers, app
developers, and business partners internationally;

• higher costs associated with doing business internationally, including
costs related to local advisors;

• export or import regulations; and

• trade and tariff restrictions.

Our ability to successfully gain market acceptance in any particular
international market is uncertain and, in the past, we have experienced
difficulties and have not been successful in all the countries we have
entered. If we are unable to continue to expand internationally or manage
the complexity of our global operations successfully, our business,
financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Our business is subject to economic, market, public health, and geopolitical
conditions as well as to natural disasters beyond our control.

Our business is subject to economic, market, public health, and geopolitical
conditions, as well as natural disasters beyond our control. For example, we
have a partner studio located in Belarus with additional operations in
Ukraine. The impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the resulting
geopolitical environment in those regions on their operations and other
consulting resources we have in the area is unknown at this time. However,
we may experience interruptions or delays in the services they provide to us
as a result of such geopolitical volatilities. While not material to the
operation of our business, management and our board of directors have
discussed and assessed, and will continue to discuss and assess, any risks
related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, including but not limited to, risks
related to cybersecurity, sanctions, and personnel based in affected regions
to ensure we are prepared to react to new developments or further sanctions
as they arise. If we are unable to promptly or properly react to new
developments or further sanctions related to that region, we may be subject
to penalties or other negative consequences which could adversely impact our
business.

Further, our revenue is driven in part by discretionary consumer spending
habits and preferences, and by advertising spending patterns. Historically,
consumer purchasing and advertising spending have each declined during
economic downturns and periods of uncertainty regarding future economic
prospects or when disposable income or consumer lending is lower. General
macro-economic conditions, such as inflation or a recession or economic
slowdown in the United States or internationally, including those resulting
from the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical issues, could create uncertainty
and adversely affect discretionary consumer spending habits and preferences
as well as advertising spending. Uncertain economic conditions may also
adversely affect our clients. As a result, we may be unable to continue to
grow in the event of future economic slowdowns. We are particularly
susceptible to market conditions and risks associated with the mobile app
ecosystem, which also include the popularity, price, and timing of our Apps,
changes in user demographics, the availability and popularity of other forms
of entertainment, and critical reviews and public tastes and preferences,
which may change rapidly and cannot necessarily be predicted.

Additionally, our principal offices are located in the San Francisco Bay
Area, an area known for earthquakes and susceptible to fires, and are thus
vulnerable to damage. All of our facilities are also vulnerable to damage
from natural or manmade disasters, including power loss, earthquakes, fires,
explosions, floods, communications failures, terrorist attacks, contagious
disease outbreak (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), and similar events. If any
                                     54                                     
Table of contents
disaster were to occur, our ability to operate our business at our
facilities could be impaired and we could incur significant losses, recovery
from which may require substantial time and expense.

Our business depends in part on our ability to increase in-app purchases,
manage the economies in our Apps and respond to changes with respect to in-
app purchases, and any failure to do so could adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.

Our Apps portfolio depends in part on our ability to increase the amount of
IAPs in our Apps, which requires our studios to effectively design mobile
games and other apps that create features and virtual goods for which users
will pay. Users make IAPs because of the perceived in-app value of virtual
goods, which is dependent on the relative ease of obtaining an equivalent
good by playing our mobile games. The perceived in-app value of these
virtual goods can be impacted by various actions that we take in the mobile
games including offering discounts for virtual goods, giving away virtual
goods in promotions, or providing easier non-paid means to secure these
goods. Managing virtual economies is difficult and relies on our assumptions
and judgement. Further, changes in user preferences, including with respect
to how they interact with mobile apps and general views towards IAPs, could
decrease levels of spending on IAPs on our Apps and in the mobile app
ecosystem generally. If we fail to manage our virtual economies properly or
fail to promptly and successfully respond to any disruption in such
economies, our reputation may be harmed and our users may be less likely to
play our mobile games and to purchase virtual goods from us in the future,
which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results
of operations.

In addition, changes in the policies of Apple, Google, or other third-party
platforms, or changes in accounting policies promulgated by the Securities
and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), and national accounting standards bodies
affecting software and virtual goods revenue recognition, could further
significantly affect the way we report revenue related to IAPs, which could
adversely affect our results of operations. Any changes in user, third-party
platform, or regulator views towards IAPs, or any inability by us to respond
to changing trends with respect to IAPs, could adversely affect our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We anticipate increasing our operating expenses in the future, and we may
not be able to achieve or maintain our profitability in any given period. If
we cannot achieve or maintain our profitability, our business could be
adversely affected.

Although we have been profitable on a GAAP basis and had positive cash flow
from operations in certain prior periods, we may not always achieve
sufficient revenue or manage our expenses in order to achieve positive cash
flow from operations or profitability in any given period. Our operating
expenses may continue to rise as we implement additional initiatives
designed to increase revenue, potentially including: developing our Core
Technologies, Software Platform and technology stack, launching Apps,
strategic acquisitions and partnerships, business client and user
acquisition spending, international expansion, hiring additional employees,
and taking other steps to strengthen and grow our company. We are likely to
recognize costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the
anticipated benefits, and the return on these investments may be lower, or
may develop more slowly, than we expect. We also anticipate that the costs
of acquiring new clients and mobile app users, and otherwise marketing our
Software Platform and Apps, will continue to rise. Further, we may continue
to incur significant costs in connection with strategic acquisitions and
partnerships, which costs may increase or become more concentrated to the
extent we enter into larger transactions. If we are not able to maintain
positive cash flow in the long term, we may require additional financing,
which may not be available on favorable terms or at all, and which may be
dilutive to our stockholders. If we are unable to generate adequate revenue
growth and manage our expenses, we may incur significant losses in the
future and may not be able to maintain positive cash flow from operations or
profitability.

The COVID-19 pandemic and responses thereto across the globe have altered
how individuals interact with each other and affected how we and our
business partners are operating, and the extent to which this situation will
impact our future results of operations remains uncertain.

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and resulting social distancing and shelter-
in-place orders put in place around the world have caused widespread
disruption in global economies, productivity, and financial markets and have
altered the way in which we conduct our day-to-day business.

The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and the various responses
thereto impact our business, operations, and results of operations will
depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately
predict, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic, including any
potential future waves of the pandemic; governmental, business, and
individual actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to
the pandemic; the effect on our clients; disruptions or restrictions on our
employees’ ability to work and travel; the availability and cost to access
the capital markets; and interruptions related to our cloud networking and
mobile app
                                     55                                     
Table of contents
infrastructure and that impact our business partners, platform providers,
clients, and customer service and support providers. While substantially all
of our business operations can be performed remotely , many of our employees
are juggling additional work-related and personal challenges. With the
general shift to remote work, we are able to tap into candidate pools
previously unavailable to us, but candidates have also sought increased
flexibility and may have more options available to them. We will continue to
actively monitor the issues raised by the COVID-19 pandemic and may take
further actions that alter our business operations, including as may be
required by federal, state, local, or foreign authorities or that we
determine are in the best interests of our employees, users, business
partners, and stockholders.

In addition to the potential direct impacts to our business, the global
economy has been, and is likely to continue to be, significantly weakened as
a result of the actions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and
future government intervention remains uncertain. A weakened global economy
may negatively impact our business partners as well as our users’ in-app
purchasing decisions and users’ buying decisions across the globe generally,
which could adversely affect advertiser activity. We may experience
heightened levels of variability in the pricing of advertising both in terms
of user acquisition and as it relates to our Software Platform and Apps. If
these conditions result in significant decreased pricing of advertising, the
revenue we make from our Software Platform and advertisers paying to display
advertisements in our Apps could be adversely affected, particularly if the
levels of user engagement in our Apps are not sufficient to offset these
declines, and we may experience increased pressure on our overall margins.
If we are not able to respond to and manage the direct and indirect impact
of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, then our business, financial
condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.
Our company culture has contributed to our success and if we cannot maintain
this culture as we grow, our business could be harmed.
We believe that our company culture has been critical to our success and
will be important for our continued growth. We face a number of challenges
that may affect our ability to sustain our corporate culture, including:
failure to identify, attract, reward, and retain people in leadership
positions in our organization who share and further our culture and values;
the increasing size and geographic diversity of our workforce; competitive
pressures to move in directions that may divert us from our culture and
values; the continued challenges of a rapidly-evolving industry; the
increasing need to develop expertise in new areas of business that affect
us; a negative perception of our treatment of employees or our response to
employee sentiment related to political or social causes or actions of
management; and the integration of new personnel and businesses from
acquisitions. If we are not able to maintain our culture, we could lose the
innovation, passion, and dedication of our team and as a result, our
business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely
affected.

If we do not successfully or cost-effectively invest in, establish, and
maintain awareness of the AppLovin brand, our business, financial condition,
and results of operations could be adversely affected.

We believe that establishing and maintaining the AppLovin brand is critical
to maintaining and creating favorable relationships with, and our ability to
attract, new clients, particularly Software Platform Enterprise Clients, and
key personnel. Increasing awareness of the AppLovin brand will depend
largely upon our marketing efforts and our ability to successfully
differentiate our Software Platform from the offerings of our competitors.
In addition, successfully globalizing and extending our brand requires
significant investment and extensive management time. If we fail to maintain
and increase brand awareness and recognition of our Software Platform, our
business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely
affected.
We generally do not have long-term agreements with our clients.
Our clients are not required to enter into long-term agreements with us and
may choose to stop using our Software Platform at any time. For example, our
advertising agreements can be executed in as little as one day and can be
terminated for convenience on two days’ notice. In order to continue to grow
our Software Platform, we must consistently provide offerings that clients
see as valuable and choose to use. If we fail to maintain our relationships
with our clients, or if the terms of these relationships become less
favorable to us, our results of operations would be harmed. Additionally, as
certain of our clients are also our competitors, these clients may choose to
invest in their own offerings rather than continue to use our Software
Platform. Any failure to maintain our relationships with clients could
adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.

If our Apps do not meet user expectations, or contain objectionable content,
our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations
could be adversely affected.

Expectations regarding the quality, performance, and integrity of our Apps
are high. We must continually adapt to changing user preferences including
the popularity of various game categories, style of play, and IAP
                                     56                                     
Table of contents
options. Users may be critical of our Apps, business models, or business
practices for a wide variety of reasons, including perceptions about
gameplay, fairness, game content, features, or services. Independent
industry analysts may publish reviews of our Apps from time to time, as well
as those of our competitors, and perception of our Apps in the marketplace
may be significantly influenced by these reviews. We have no control over
what users or these industry analysts report. If users and industry analysts
negatively respond to our Apps or changes that we make to our Apps, or
provide negative reviews of our Apps, our reputation, business, financial
condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Further, despite reasonable precautions, some users may be offended by
certain mobile app content, advertisements displayed in our Apps or by the
treatment of other users. For example, if users believe that an
advertisement displayed in an App contains objectionable content, we could
experience damage to our brand and reputation and users could refuse to play
such game and pressure platform providers to remove the App from their
platforms. While such content may violate our terms and we may subsequently
remove it, our brand and reputation may nonetheless be harmed and our
clients may become dissatisfied with our services. Furthermore, steps that
we may take in response to such instances, such as temporarily or
permanently shutting off access of a user to our Apps, could adversely
affect our business and results of operations. Any failure to meet user
expectations or provide our Apps without objectionable content could
adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, and results
of operations.

The proliferation of “cheating” programs and scam offers that seek to
exploit our mobile games and users may adversely affect game-playing
experiences and lead users to stop playing our mobile games. Our failure to
maintain a customer support ecosystem may enhance these risks.

Our users rely on our customer support organization to resolve any issues
relating to our mobile games. Customer support is important for satisfying
user expectations regarding the quality, performance, and integrity of our
mobile games. We currently have limited customer support operations. If we
do not effectively train, supplement, and manage our customer support
organization to assist our users, and if that support organization does not
succeed in helping users quickly resolve issues or provide effective ongoing
support, we could experience decreased user engagement and harm to our
reputation with potential new users.

Additionally, unrelated third parties have developed, and may continue to
develop, “cheating” programs that enable users to exploit vulnerabilities in
our mobile games, play them in an automated way, collude to alter the
intended game play, or obtain unfair advantages over other users who do play
fairly. These programs harm the experience of users who play fairly and may
disrupt the virtual economies of our mobile games and reduce the demand for
certain IAPs. In addition, unrelated third parties have attempted to scam
our users with fake offers for virtual goods or other game benefits. These
unauthorized or fraudulent transactions are usually arranged on third-party
websites and the virtual goods offered may have been obtained through
unauthorized means, such as exploiting vulnerabilities in our mobile games,
or may be fraudulent offers. We do not generate any revenue from these
transactions. These unauthorized purchases and sales from third-party
sellers have in the past and could in the future impede our revenue and
profit growth.

There can be no assurance that our customer support and other efforts to
detect, prevent, or minimize these unauthorized or fraudulent transactions
will be successful, that these actions will not increase over time or that
our customer support efforts will be successful in resolving user issues.
Any failure to maintain adequate customer support or success of third-party
cheating programs or scams may negatively affect game-playing experiences
and lead users to stop playing our mobile games, which could adversely
affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We are subject to laws and regulations concerning privacy, information
security, data protection, consumer protection, advertising, tracking,
targeting, and protection of minors, and these laws and regulations are
continually evolving. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with these
laws and regulations could adversely affect our business, financial
condition, and results of operations.

We receive, store, and process personal information and other data,
including data relating to individuals and households, and we enable our
users to share their personal information with each other and with third
parties, including within our Apps. There are numerous federal, state, and
local laws around the world regarding privacy and the collection, storing,
sharing, use, processing, disclosure, deletion, and protection of personal
information and other data, including data relating to individuals and
households, the scope of which are changing, subject to differing
interpretations, and may be inconsistent between countries or conflict with
other rules.

Various government and consumer agencies have called for new regulation and
changes in industry practices and are continuing to review the need for
greater regulation for the collection of information concerning consumer
behavior on the internet, including regulation aimed at restricting certain
targeted advertising practices. For example, the GDPR, which became
effective in May 2018, created new individual privacy rights and imposed
worldwide obligations on companies processing personal data of European
Union (EU) users, which has created a greater compliance burden for us and
other companies with European users, and subjects violators to substantial
monetary penalties. The United Kingdom has implemented legislation that
substantially implements the GDPR and which also provides for substantial
monetary penalties. In June 2021, the European Commission announced a
decision of “adequacy” concluding that the United Kingdom ensures an
equivalent level of data protection to the GDPR, which provides some relief
regarding the legality of continued personal data flows from the European
Economic Area to the United Kingdom. Such adequacy decision must, however,
be renewed after four years and may be modified or revoked in the interim.
We cannot fully predict how United Kingdom data protection laws or
regulations may develop in the medium to longer term, nor the effects of
divergent laws and guidance regarding how data transfers to and from the
United Kingdom will be regulated.

With regard to transfers to the United States of personal data (as such term
is used in the GDPR and applicable EU member state legislation) from our
employees and European users and other third parties, we have relied upon
the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield as well as certain standard
contractual clauses approved by the EU Commission (the "SCCs"); however,
both the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and the SCCs have been subject to legal
challenge, and on July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the EU, Europe’s
highest court, held in the Schrems II case that the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield
was invalid, and imposed additional obligations in connection with the use
of the SCCs. This decision imposes restrictions on the ability to transfer
personal data from the EU and Switzerland to the United States, and with the
exit of the United Kingdom from the EU, we and other companies face
additional restrictions on transfers of personal data from the United
Kingdom. EU regulators since have issued additional guidance regarding these
additional requirements that we and other companies must consider and
undertake when using the SCCs. On June 4, 2021, the European Commission
adopted new SCCs, taking into account the Schrems II case and reflecting
requirements under the GDPR. The decision foresees an 18-month grace period
for companies to adopt the new SCCs, subject to obligations to use the SCCs
for new contracts and data processing operations as of September 27, 2021
and by December 27, 2022, replace previous SCCs included in existing
contracts concluded before September 27, 2021. Additionally, the United
Kingdom’s Information Commissioner’s Office issued new standard contractual
clauses to support personal data transfers out of the United Kingdom on
February 2, 2022 that became effective March 21, 2022 and are required to be
used for new contractual arrangements as of September 21, 2022, and must
replace prior standard contractual clauses as of March 21, 2024. We are in
the process of assessing these developments and their impact on our data
transfer mechanisms. The SCCs and other cross-border data transfer
mechanisms may face additional legal challenges or be the subject of
additional legislative activity and regulatory guidance. We and many other
companies may need to implement different or additional measures to
establish or maintain legitimate means for the transfer and receipt of
personal data from the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and the United
Kingdom to the United States, and we may, in addition to other impacts,
experience additional costs associated with increased compliance burdens,
and we and our clients face the potential for regulators to apply different
standards to the transfer of personal data from the European Economic Area,
Switzerland, and the United Kingdom to the United States, and to block, or
require ad hoc verification of measures taken with respect to, certain data
flows from the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom
to the United States. We also may be required to engage in contract
negotiations with third parties that aid in processing data on our behalf,
to the extent that any of our service providers, or consultants have been
relying on invalidated or insufficient contractual protections for
compliance with evolving interpretations of and guidance for cross-border
data transfers pursuant to the GDPR, Swiss privacy laws, and United Kingdom
privacy laws. In such cases, we may not be able to find alternative service
providers which could limit our ability to process personal data from the
European Economic Area, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom and increase our
costs and/or impact our Core Technologies, Software Platform, Apps, or other
offerings. We and our clients may face a risk of enforcement actions by data
protection authorities in the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and the
United Kingdom relating to personal data transfers. Any such enforcement
actions could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources,
distract management and technical personnel, and adversely affect our
business, financial condition, and results of operations. Similar to GDPR,
in September 2020, Brazil enacted the Brazilian General Data Protection Law
("LGPD"). In August 2021, China passed a new data privacy law known as PIPL,
effective November 1, 2021, which adopts a stringent data transfer regime
requiring, among other things, data subject consent for certain data
transfers. Any of these developments may have an adverse effect on our
business.
                                     58                                     
Table of contents
Moreover, the GDPR and other similar regulations require companies to give
specific types of notice and in some cases seek consent from consumers and
other data subjects before collecting or using their data for certain
purposes, including some marketing activities. In addition to the GDPR, the
European Commission has another draft regulation in the approval process
that focuses on a person’s right to conduct a private life. The proposed
legislation, known as the Regulation of Privacy and Electronic
Communications ("ePrivacy Regulation"), would replace the current ePrivacy
Directive. Originally planned to be adopted and implemented at the same time
as the GDPR, the ePrivacy Regulation is still being negotiated. On February
10, 2021, the Council of the EU agreed on its version of the draft ePrivacy
Regulation. If adopted, the earliest date for entry into force is in 2023,
with broad potential impacts on the use of internet-based services and
tracking technologies, such as cookies. Aspects of the ePrivacy Regulation
remain for negotiation between the European Commission and the Council.

Another example is California’s passage of the CCPA, which went into effect
on January 1, 2020, with implementing regulations taking effect August 14,
2020, and which created new privacy rights for users residing in the state,
including a private right of action for data breaches. The California
Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) was approved by California voters in November
2020, goes into effect on January 1, 2023, and will significantly modify the
CCPA, potentially resulting in further uncertainty and requiring us to incur
additional costs and expenses in an effort to comply. Additionally, other
states appear to be following California's lead and are considering new,
comprehensive privacy legislation, some of which contemplate private rights
of action, which may increase the likelihood of class action litigation,
that could also adversely affect our reputation, business, financial
condition, and results of operations. For example, Nevada, Virginia,
Colorado, and Utah have similarly enacted comprehensive privacy laws - The
Nevada Privacy Law taking effect October 1, 2019, the Consumer Data
Protection Act taking effect on January 1, 2023, the Colorado Privacy Act
taking effect on July 1, 2023, and the Utah Consumer Privacy Act taking
effect on December 31, 2023, respectively - all of which emulate the CCPA
and CPRA in many respects. Our efforts to comply with the GDPR, CCPA, COPPA,
and similar legal requirements, such as Brazil's LGPD and China's PIPL, has
required us and will continue to require us to devote significant
operational resources and incur significant expenses. Our privacy and data
protection compliance and oversight efforts will require significant time
and attention from our management and board of directors.

Further, children’s privacy has been a focus of recent enforcement
activities and subjects our business to potential liability that could
adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.
Enforcement of COPPA, which requires companies to obtain parental consent
before collecting personal information from children known to be under the
age of thirteen or from child-directed websites or online services, has
increased in recent years. In addition, the GDPR prohibits certain
processing of the personal information of children under the age of thirteen
to sixteen (depending on jurisdiction) without parental consent where
consent is used as the lawful basis for processing that personal
information. The CCPA requires companies to obtain the consent of children
in California under the age of sixteen (or parental consent for children
under the age of thirteen) before selling their personal information.There
also may be various laws, regulations, industry standards, codes of conduct,
or other actual or asserted obligations relating to children’s privacy to
which we may be, or be asserted to be, subject, or that may otherwise impact
our business and operations. For example, the United Kingdom’s Age
Appropriate Design Code is one such regulatory framework that has been
adopted in the United Kingdom that focuses on online safety and protection
of children’s privacy online, and similar frameworks are being considered
for adoption in other jurisdictions. Although we take reasonable efforts to
comply with these laws, regulations, and certain other standards, we may in
the future face claims under COPPA, the GDPR, the CCPA, or other laws,
regulations, or other actual or asserted obligations relating to children’s
privacy.

All of our mobile games are subject to privacy policies and terms of service
located in application storefronts, within our mobile games, and on our
respective websites. We endeavor to comply with industry standards and are
subject to the terms of our privacy-related obligations and commitments to
users and third parties. We strive to comply with all applicable laws,
policies, legal obligations, and certain industry codes of conduct relating
to privacy and data protection, to the extent reasonably attainable.
However, it is possible that these or other actual or asserted obligations
relating to privacy, data protection, or information security may be
interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one
jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices.
It is also possible that new laws, policies, legal obligations, or industry
codes of conduct may be passed, or existing laws, policies, legal
obligations, or industry codes of conduct may be interpreted in such a way
that could prevent us from being able to offer services to residents of a
certain jurisdiction or may make it costlier or more difficult for us to do
so. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our terms of
service or privacy policy, or with applicable laws, regulations, or legal,
contractual, or other actual or asserted obligations to users or third
parties, concerning privacy, information security, data protection, consumer
protection, or protection of minors; or our privacy-related legal
obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized
release or transfer of personal information or other user data, may result
in governmental enforcement actions or other proceedings, claims,
                                     59                                     
Table of contents
demands, and litigation by private parties, or public statements against us
by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause our users to lose
trust in us, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition,
or results of operations. Additionally, if third parties we work with, such
as users, developers, vendors, service providers, or other business partners
violate applicable laws or our policies, such violations may also put our
users’ information at risk and could in turn adversely affect our
reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign laws, many of which
are unsettled and still developing, which could subject us to claims or
otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.

We are subject to a variety of laws in the United States and abroad that
affect our business, including state and federal laws regarding consumer
protection, electronic marketing, protection of minors, data protection, and
privacy, competition, taxation, intellectual property, money transmission,
money laundering, investment screening, export, and national security, which
are continuously evolving and developing. The scope and interpretation of
the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be
conflicting, particularly laws outside the United States. There is a risk
that existing or future laws may be interpreted in a manner that is not
consistent with our current practices and which could adversely affect our
business. As our Software Platform grows and evolves and our Software
Platform and our Apps are used in a greater number of countries, we may also
become subject to laws and regulations in additional jurisdictions or other
jurisdictions may claim that we are required to comply with their laws and
regulations.

With respect to our Apps, we are potentially subject to a number of foreign
and domestic laws and regulations that affect the offering of certain types
of content, such as content that depicts violence, the social casino game
genre, or loot boxes, many of which are ambiguous or still evolving and
could be interpreted in ways that could adversely affect our business or
expose us to liability. Some state attorney generals as well as other
international regulatory bodies have brought and may continue to bring legal
actions against social casino app developers and the third-party
distribution platforms for such apps. Further, several jurisdictions have
been regulating and continue to regulate the use of loot boxes in mobile
games. Loot boxes are a commonly used monetization technique in free-to-play
mobile games in which a user can acquire a virtual loot box, typically
through mobile game play or by using virtual goods, but the user does not
know which virtual good(s) he or she will receive (which may be a common,
rare, or extremely rare item, and may be a duplicate of an item the user
already has in his or her inventory) until the loot box is opened. The user
will always receive one or more virtual goods when he or she opens the loot
box, but the user does not know exactly which item(s) until the loot box is
opened. In April 2018, each of the Belgian Gaming Commission and the Dutch
Gambling Authority declared that loot boxes as implemented in certain games
by other companies that they reviewed constituted illegal gambling under
each country’s laws. Further, the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") has
examined consumer protection issues related to loot boxes and various other
jurisdictions, including certain U.S. states, Australia, Brazil, and the
United Kingdom are reviewing or have indicated that they intend to review
the legality of loot boxes and whether they constitute gambling.
Additionally, in 2021, Germany approved a new Youth Protection Act, that
came into effect on May 1, 2021, which makes it unlawful to sell video games
that contain loot boxes to minors. In some of our mobile games, certain
mechanics may be deemed as “loot boxes”. New regulation by the FTC, U.S.
states, or other international jurisdictions could require that these game
mechanics be modified or removed from games or that such apps be changed
entirely, both of which could increase the costs of operating our mobile
games, impact user engagement and monetization, or otherwise adversely
affect our business. In addition, the increased attention focused upon
liability issues as a result of lawsuits and legislative proposals could
harm our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business. It is
difficult to predict how existing or new laws may be applied to these or
similar game mechanics or genres. Further, laws or regulations may vary
significantly across jurisdictions.

It is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted or
construed to apply to us in the United States and elsewhere that could
restrict the mobile app ecosystem, including user privacy, data protection,
advertising, communications, taxation, content suitability, copyright,
distribution, and antitrust. Furthermore, the growth and development of
electronic commerce and virtual goods may prompt calls for more stringent
consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on companies
such as ours conducting business through the internet and mobile devices.
For example, China implemented a new policy in September 2021 that restricts
online gaming for those under age 18 to one hour in the evening on Fridays,
weekends and public holidays. We anticipate that scrutiny and regulation of
our industry will increase and we will be required to devote legal and other
resources to addressing such regulation. For example, existing laws or new
laws regarding the marketing of IAPs, labeling of free-to-play mobile games,
or regulation of currency, banking institutions, unclaimed property or money
transmission may be interpreted to cover our mobile games and the virtual
currency, goods, or payments that we
                                     60

receive. We may also expand into new business opportunities that subject us
to additional laws and regulations. As such, we may be required to seek
licenses, authorizations, or approvals from relevant regulators, the
granting of which may be dependent on us meeting certain capital and other
requirements and we may be subject to additional regulation and oversight,
all of which could significantly increase our operating costs. Changes in
current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws and regulations in
the United States or elsewhere regarding these activities may lessen the
growth of the mobile app ecosystem. Any costs incurred as a result of
adapting to laws and regulations, or as a result of liability in connection
therewith, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and
results of operations.

We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and similar anti-
corruption and anti-bribery laws, and non-compliance with such laws could
subject us to criminal penalties or significant fines and adversely affect
our business and reputation.

We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the "FCPA"), the U.S.
domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. § 201, the U.S. Travel Act,
and similar anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws applicable in the
jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Anti-corruption and anti-bribery
laws have been enforced aggressively in recent years, are interpreted
broadly and prohibit companies, their employees, and third party business
partners, representatives, and agents from promising, authorizing, making or
offering improper payments or other benefits, directly or indirectly, to
government officials and others in the private sector in order to influence
official action, direct business to any person, gain any improper advantage,
or obtain or retain business. As we continue to expand our business
internationally, our risks under these laws increase.

We and our third-party business partners, representatives, and agents may
have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of
government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and we may be held
liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of our employees, third-
party business partners, representatives, and agents, even if we do not
explicitly authorize such activities. These laws also require that we keep
accurate books and records and maintain internal controls and compliance
procedures designed to prevent any such actions. While we have policies and
procedures to address compliance with such laws, we cannot assure you that
our employees, third-party business partners, representatives, and agents
will not take actions in violation of our policies or applicable law, for
which we may be ultimately held responsible and our exposure for violating
these laws increases as our international presence expands and as we
increase sales and operations in foreign jurisdictions.

Any violation of the FCPA or other applicable anti-corruption laws could
result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations,
loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions, suspension or
disbarment from U.S. government contracts, substantial diversion of
management’s attention, significant legal fees and fines, severe criminal or
civil sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, disgorgement of
profits, other sanctions and remedial measures, and prohibitions on the
conduct of our business, any of which could adversely affect our reputation,
business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We are subject to governmental export controls and economic sanctions laws
that could impair our ability to compete in global markets or subject us to
liability if we violate the controls.

Our Core Technologies, Software Platform, and Apps may be subject to U.S.
export controls. Exports of our products and the underlying technology may
require export authorizations, including by license, a license exception, or
other appropriate government authorizations, including the filing of an
encryption classification request or self-classification report, as
applicable.

Furthermore, our activities are subject to U.S. economic sanctions laws and
regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of
Foreign Assets Control that prohibit the shipment of most technologies to
embargoed jurisdictions or sanctioned parties without the required export
authorizations. If we need to obtain any necessary export license or other
authorization for a particular sale, the process may be time-consuming and
may result in the delay or loss of opportunities to sell our products.

We take precautions to prevent our products and the underlying technology
from being provided, deployed or used in violation of export control and
sanctions laws, including implementation of IP address blocking and
sanctioned person screening, and are in the process of further enhancing our
policies and procedures relating to export control and sanctions compliance.
However, we cannot assure you that our policies and procedures relating to
export control and sanctions compliance will prevent violations in the
future by us or our partners or agents. If we are found to be in violation
of U.S. sanctions or export control regulations, including failure to obtain
appropriate import, export, or re-export licenses or permits, it can result
in significant penalties and government investigations, as well as
reputational harm and loss of business. Knowing and willful violations can
result in possible incarcerations for responsible employees and managers.
                                     61                                     
Table of contents
In addition to the United States, various other countries regulate the
import and export of certain encryption and other technology, including
import and export licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could
limit our ability to distribute our products or could limit our clients’
ability to implement our products in those countries. Changes in our Core
Technologies, Software Platform, or Apps, or future changes in export and
import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products and
the underlying technology in international markets, prevent our clients with
global operations from deploying our products globally, or, in some cases,
prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries,
governments, or persons altogether. From time to time, various governmental
agencies have proposed additional regulation of encryption technology.

Our growth strategy includes further expanding our operations and client and
user base in international markets and acquiring companies that may operate
in countries where we do not already do business. Such acquisitions may
subject us to additional or expanded export regulations. Further, any change
in export or import regulations or controls, economic sanctions or related
legislation, or change in the countries, governments, persons, or
technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of
our products by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products
to, existing or potential clients with global operations. Any decreased use
of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products
in major international markets could adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.

Changes in tax laws or tax rulings could adversely affect our effective tax
rates, business, financial condition, and results of operations.

The tax regimes we are subject to or operate under are unsettled and may be
subject to significant change. Changes in tax laws (including in response to
the COVID-19 pandemic) or tax rulings, or changes in interpretations of
existing laws, could cause us to be subject to additional income-based taxes
and non-income taxes (such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, digital, net
worth, property, and goods and services taxes), which in turn could
adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. For
example, in December 2017, the U.S. federal government enacted the tax
reform legislation known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "2017 Tax Act").
The 2017 Tax Act significantly changed the existing U.S. corporate income
tax laws by, among other things, lowering the U.S. corporate tax rate,
implementing a partially territorial tax system, and imposing a one-time
deemed repatriation tax on certain post-1986 foreign earnings. There is
currently significant tax legislation pending before Congress which, among
other tax provisions, repeals and/or modifies key provisions of the 2017 Tax
Act. If passed, this legislation could materially impact our tax
obligations, including by increasing our effective tax rate. In addition,
beginning in 2022, the Tax Act will require U.S. research and experimental
expenditures to be capitalized and amortized ratably over a five-year
period. Any such expenditures attributable to research conducted outside the
U.S. must be capitalized and amortized over a 15-year period. Furthermore,
many countries in the European Union, as well as a number of other countries
and organizations such as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
Development, have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax
laws or have enacted new laws that could impact our tax obligations. Some of
these or other new rules could result in double taxation of our
international earnings. Any significant changes to our future effective tax
rate could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results
of operations.
We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.
Our income tax obligations are based in part on our corporate operating
structure and intercompany arrangements, including the manner in which we
develop, value, manage, and use our intellectual property and the valuation
of our intercompany transactions. The tax laws applicable to our business,
including the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions, are subject
to interpretation and certain jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting
their laws in new ways in an effort to raise additional tax revenue. Our
existing corporate structure and intercompany arrangements have been
implemented in a manner we believe is in compliance with current prevailing
tax laws. However, the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we
operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or
intercompany arrangements, which could impact our worldwide effective tax
rate and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Moreover, changes to our corporate structure and intercompany agreements,
including through acquisitions, could impact our worldwide effective tax
rate and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.

In addition, we are subject to federal, state, and local taxes in the United
States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required
in evaluating our tax positions and our worldwide provision for (benefit
from) taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many
activities and transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is
uncertain. Our tax obligations and effective tax rates could be adversely
affected by changes in the relevant tax, accounting, and other laws,
regulations, principles, and interpretations, including those relating to
income tax nexus, by our earnings being lower than anticipated in
jurisdictions where we have lower
                                     62                                     
Table of contents
statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have
higher statutory rates, by challenges to our intercompany relationships and
transfer pricing arrangements. The relevant taxing authorities may disagree
with our determinations as to the income and expenses attributable to
specific jurisdictions. If such a disagreement were to occur, and our
position were not sustained, we could be required to pay additional taxes,
interest, and penalties, which could result in one-time tax charges, higher
effective tax rates, reduced cash flows and lower overall profitability of
our business, with some changes possibly affecting our tax obligations in
future or past years. We believe that our financial statements reflect
adequate reserves to cover such a contingency, but there can be no
assurances in that regard.

Taxing authorities may successfully assert that we should have collected or
in the future should collect sales and use, value added or similar taxes,
and any such assessments could adversely affect our business, financial
condition, and results of operations.

We do not collect sales and use, value added, and similar taxes in all
jurisdictions in which we have sales, based on our belief that such taxes
are not applicable in certain jurisdictions. Sales and use, value added, and
similar tax laws and rates vary greatly by jurisdiction. Certain
jurisdictions in which we do not collect such taxes may assert that such
taxes are applicable or that our presence in such jurisdictions is
sufficient to require us to collect taxes, which could result in tax
assessments, penalties, and interest, and we may be required to collect such
taxes in the future. Such tax assessments, penalties, and interest or future
requirements may adversely affect our financial condition and results of
operations. Further, in June 2018, the Supreme Court held in South Dakota v.
Wayfair, Inc. that states could impose sales tax collection obligations on
out-of-state sellers even if those sellers lack any physical presence within
the states imposing the sales taxes. Under the Wayfair decision, a person
requires only a “substantial nexus” with the taxing state before the state
may subject the person to sales tax collection obligations therein. An
increasing number of states (both before and after the publication of the
Wayfair decision) have considered or adopted laws that attempt to impose
sales tax collection obligations on out-of-state sellers. The Supreme
Court’s Wayfair decision has removed a significant impediment to the
enactment and enforcement of these laws, and it is possible that states may
seek to tax out-of-state sellers on sales that occurred in prior tax years,
which could create additional administrative burdens for us, put us at a
competitive disadvantage if such states do not impose similar obligations on
our competitors, and decrease our future sales, which could adversely affect
our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

If we are found liable for content that is distributed through or
advertising that is served through our Software Platform or Apps, our
business could be adversely affected.

As a distributor of content, we face potential liability for negligence,
copyright, patent or trademark infringement, public performance royalties,
or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we
distribute. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the "DMCA") is intended,
in part, to limit the liability of eligible service providers for caching,
hosting, or linking to user content that includes materials that infringe
copyrights or other rights. We rely on the protections provided by the DMCA
in conducting our business. Similarly, Section 230 of the Communications
Decency Act (Section 230) protects online distribution platforms, such as
ours, from actions taken under various laws that might otherwise impose
liability on the platform provider for what content creators develop or the
actions they take or inspire.

However, the DMCA, Section 230, and similar statutes and doctrines that we
may rely on in the future are subject to uncertain judicial interpretation
and regulatory and legislative amendments. Future regulatory or legislative
changes may ultimately require us to take a more active approach towards
content moderation, which could diminish the depth, breadth, and variety of
content we offer and, in so doing, reduce our revenue. Moreover, the DMCA
and Section 230 provide protections primarily in the United States. If the
rules around these statutes and doctrines change, if international
jurisdictions refuse to apply similar protections, or if a court were to
disagree with our application of those rules to our business, we could incur
liability and our business could be adversely affected. If we become liable
for these types of claims as a result of the content that is included in our
Apps or the advertisements that are served through our Software Platform,
then our business may be adversely affected. Litigation to defend these
claims could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any
liability could adversely affect our business. Our insurance may not be
adequate to cover these types of claims or any liability that may be imposed
on us.

In addition, regardless of any legal protections that may limit our
liability for the actions of third parties, we may incur significant legal
expenses and other costs if copyright holders assert claims, or commence
litigation, alleging copyright infringement against our third-party
developers. While we prohibit mobile apps without distribution rights from
the copyright holder, and we maintain processes and systems for the
reporting and removal of infringing mobile apps, such prohibitions,
processes, and systems may not always be successful. If other developers,

licensees, platform providers, business partners, and personnel are
influenced by the existence of types of claims or proceedings and are
deterred from working with us as a consequence, our ability to maintain or
expand our business, including through international expansion plans, could
be adversely affected.

We have incurred and will continue to incur increased costs and demands upon
management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting
public companies, which could adversely affect our business, financial
condition, and results of operations.

We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-
Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-
Frank Act"), and the rules and regulations of the SEC and the Nasdaq listing
standards. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file
annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and
results of operations. Compliance with these requirements has increased and
will continue to increase our legal, accounting, and financial compliance
costs and increase demand on our systems, making some activities more time-
consuming and costly. We expect these rules and regulations to make it more
expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we
may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur
substantially higher costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. As a
result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified
individuals to serve on our board of directors or as our executive officers.
As a public company, we have incurred and expect to incur significant
expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance
with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act. In that regard, we will need to hire additional accounting and
financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical
accounting knowledge. In addition, as a public company, we may be subject to
shareholder activism, which can lead to substantial costs, distract
management, and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways
we cannot currently anticipate.

As a result of disclosure of information in our public filings with the SEC
as required of a public company, our business and financial condition will
become more visible, which we believe may result in threatened or actual
litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If such claims
are successful, our business, financial condition, and results of operations
could be adversely affected, and even if the claims do not result in
litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and
resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our
management and our board of directors and adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.

Legal or regulatory proceedings and settlements could cause us to incur
additional expenses or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial
condition, and results of operations.

We are involved in or may become involved in claims, suits, government
investigations, including formal and informal inquiries from government
authorities and regulators, and proceedings arising in the ordinary course
of our business, including actions with respect to intellectual property
claims, securities claims, privacy, data protection, or law enforcement
matters, tax matters, labor and employment claims, commercial and
acquisition-related claims, and other matters. We may become the subject of
investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests for information, actions,
and audits in the United States, Europe, and around the world, particularly
in the areas of privacy, data protection, law enforcement, consumer
protection, and competition, as we continue to grow and expand our
operations. In addition, we are currently, and may in the future be, subject
to regulatory orders or consent decrees. For example, data protection,
competition, and consumer protection authorities in the European Union have
initiated actions, investigations, or administrative orders seeking to
restrict the ways in which we collect and use information, or impose
sanctions, and other authorities may do the same.

Any such claims, suits, government investigations, and proceedings are
inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty.
Regardless of their outcomes, such legal or regulatory proceedings can have
an adverse impact on us because of legal costs, diversion of management and
other personnel attention, and other factors. In addition, it is possible
that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in
substantial costs, civil and criminal liability, penalties, or sanctions, as
well as judgments, consent decrees, or orders preventing us from offering
certain features, functionalities, products or services, or requiring a
change in our business practices, products or technologies, which could
adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, and results
of operations.

Failure to protect or enforce our proprietary and intellectual property
rights or the costs involved in such enforcement could adversely affect our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Table of contents
We regard our Core Technologies, Software Platform, and Apps and related
source code as proprietary and rely on a variety of methods, including a
combination of copyright, patent, trademark, and trade secret laws and
employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements, to protect our
proprietary rights. We view the protection of our trade secrets, copyrights,
trademarks, service marks, trade dress, domain names, patents, and other
product rights as critical to our success. We strive to protect our
intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state, and common law
rights, as well as contractual restrictions and business practices. We also
enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our
employees and contractors and confidentiality agreements with parties with
whom we conduct business in order to limit access to, and disclosure and use
of, our proprietary information. However, these contractual arrangements and
business practices may not prevent the misappropriation of our proprietary
information or deter independent development of similar technologies by
others.

We own or license, and pursue the registration of, copyrights, trademarks,
service marks, domain names, and patents in the United States and in certain
locations outside the United States. This process can be expensive and time-
consuming, may not always be successful depending on local laws or other
circumstances, and we also may choose not to pursue registrations in every
location depending on the nature of the project to which the intellectual
property rights pertain. We may, over time, increase our investments in
protecting our creative works.

We are aware that some unauthorized copying of our Apps occurs, and if a
significantly greater amount of unauthorized copying of our Apps were to
occur, it could adversely affect our business. In addition, even if
authorized copying of our Apps occurs, third-party platforms may not remove
infringing material. We also cannot be certain that existing intellectual
property laws will provide adequate protection for our products in
connection with emerging technologies. Litigation may be necessary to
enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets, or
determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others.
Any litigation of this nature, regardless of outcome or merit, could result
in substantial costs, adverse publicity, and diversion of management and
technical resources. If we fail to maintain, protect, and enhance our
intellectual property rights, our business, financial condition, and results
of operations could be adversely affected.

We are, and may in the future be, subject to intellectual property disputes,
which are costly to defend and could require us to pay significant damages
and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future.

From time to time, we have faced, and we may face in the future, allegations
that we have infringed the trademarks, copyrights, patents, and other
intellectual property rights of third parties, including from our
competitors, non-practicing entities and former employers of our personnel.
Intellectual property litigation may be protracted and expensive, and the
results are difficult to predict. As the result of any court judgment or
settlement, we may be obligated to alter our Software Platform or Apps, in a
particular geographic region or worldwide, pay royalties or significant
settlement costs, purchase licenses, or develop substitutes.

In certain of our agreements, we also indemnify our licensees and other
business partners. We may incur significant expenses defending these
business partners if they are sued for intellectual property infringement
based on allegations related to our technology. If a business partner were
to lose a lawsuit and in turn seek indemnification from us, we also could be
subject to significant monetary liabilities. In addition, because our Core
Technologies, Software Platform, and Apps often involve the use of third-
party technology, this increases our exposure to litigation in circumstances
where there is a claim of infringement asserted against one of our mobile
games or other products and services in question, even if the claim does not
pertain to our technology.

Many of our products and services contain open source software, and we
license some of our software through open source projects, which may pose
particular risks to our proprietary software, products, and services in a
manner that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and
results of operations.

We use open source software in our Core Technologies, Software Platform, and
Apps and expect to continue to use open source software in the future. In
addition, we contribute software source code to open source projects under
open source licenses or release internal software projects under open source
licenses, and anticipate continuing to do so in the future. The terms of
many open source licenses to which we are subject have not been interpreted
by U.S. or foreign courts, and there is a risk that open source software
licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated
conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide or distribute our
products or services. Additionally, under some open source licenses, if we
combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain
manner, third parties may claim ownership of, a license to, or demand
release of, the open source software or derivative works that we developed
using such software, which could include our proprietary source code. Such
third parties may also seek to enforce the terms of the applicable open
source license through litigation which, if successful, could require us to
make our proprietary software source code freely available,
                                     65                                     
Table of contents
purchase a costly license, or cease offering the implicated products or
services unless and until we can re-engineer them to avoid infringement.
This re-engineering process could require significant additional research
and development resources, and we may not be able to complete it
successfully. In addition to risks related to open source license
requirements, use of certain open source software may pose greater risks
than use of third-party commercial software, since open source licensors
generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of software.
Any of these risks could be difficult to eliminate or manage, and, if not
addressed, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and
results of operations.

Our ability to acquire and maintain licenses to intellectual property may
affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Competition for these licenses may make them more expensive and increase our
costs.

While most of the intellectual property we use in our Core Technologies,
Software Platform, and Apps is created by us, from time to time, we also
acquire rights to third-party intellectual property. Proprietary licenses
may limit our use of intellectual property to specific uses and for specific
time periods, require time and attention of licensors in providing guidance
and related approvals, and include other contractual obligations with which
we must comply. Additionally, competition for these licenses is intense and
often results in increased advances, minimum payment guarantees, and
royalties to the licensor, and as such we may be unable to identify suitable
licensing targets or complete licensing arrangements. If we are unable to
obtain and remain in compliance with the terms of these licenses or obtain
additional licenses on reasonable economic terms, our business and results
of operations could be adversely affected. Further, if the mix of IAPs
shifts toward mobile games in which we use licensed intellectual property or
if we develop additional Apps that require licensing of third-party
intellectual property, our overall margins may be reduced due to royalty
obligations.

In addition, many of our Apps are built on proprietary source code of third
parties, such as Unity Software. Unity Software offers certain solutions
that may compete with our offerings. If we are unable to renew licenses to
proprietary source code underlying our mobile games, or the terms and
conditions of these licenses change at the time of renewal, our business,
financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.
We rely on third parties, including Unity Software, to maintain versions of
their proprietary engines that allow us to distribute our mobile games on
multiple platforms. If a third party from whom we license source code
discontinues support for one or more of these platforms, our business,
financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.
                                                                            
   Risks Related to Financial and Accounting Matters                        
                                                                            
If we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and
internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and
accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be
impaired.

As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the
Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the rules and regulations of the
applicable Nasdaq listing standards. We expect that the requirements of
these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting,
and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-
consuming and costly, and place significant strain on our personnel,
systems, and resources.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain
effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure
controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we will file with the SEC
is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods
specified in SEC rules and forms and that information required to be
disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to our principal executive and financial officers. We are also continuing to
improve our internal control over financial reporting, which includes hiring
additional accounting and financial personnel to implement such processes
and controls.

In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we
have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant
resources, including accounting-related costs and significant management
oversight. If any of these new or improved controls and systems do not
perform as expected, we may experience further deficiencies in our controls.

Our current controls and any new controls that we develop may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. Further, to the
extent we acquire other businesses, the acquired company may not have a
sufficiently robust system of controls and we may discover deficiencies. Any
failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties
encountered in their implementation or improvement could adversely affect
our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting
obligations and may result in a restatement of our
                                     66

financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and
maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could
adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual
independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we
will eventually be required to include in our periodic reports that will be
filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and
internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose
confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would
likely cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline. In
addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may
not be able to remain listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. Prior to
our initial public offering, we were not required to comply with the SEC
rules that implement Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and were
therefore not required to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of
our internal control over financial reporting for that purpose. As a public
company, we are required to provide an annual management report on the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting commencing
with our second annual report on Form 10-K.

Our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to
formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting commencing with our second annual report on Form 10-K. At such
time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report
that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our
internal control over financial reporting is documented, designed, or
operating. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and
internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect our
business, financial condition, and results of operations and could cause the
market price of our Class A common stock to decline.

Our results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in
financial accounting standards or by the application of existing or future
accounting standards to our business as it evolves.

Our reported results of operations are impacted by the accounting standards
promulgated by the SEC and accounting standards bodies and the methods,
estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies. A
change in accounting standards could have a significant effect on our
reported financial results, and may even affect the reporting of
transactions completed before the announcement or effectiveness of a change.
The frequency of accounting standards changes could accelerate, including
conversion to unified international accounting standards. Accounting
standards affecting revenue recognition have affected, and could further
significantly affect, the way we account for revenue. Any future changes to
accounting standards may cause our results of operations to fluctuate. For
example, if the accounting standards for revenue derived from free-to-play
mobile games were to change, particularly with respect to revenue generated
from digital storefronts, our results of operations could be adversely
affected.

Further, although we believe our estimates are reasonable based on available
user information, we may revise such estimates in the future in the event
our users’ average playing period changes. Any adjustments arising from
changes in the estimates of the lives of these virtual goods would be
applied to the current quarter and prospectively on the basis that such
changes are caused by new information indicating a change in the user
behavior patterns of our users. As we enhance, expand and diversify our
business and product offerings, the application of existing or future
financial accounting standards could adversely our results of operations.

We rely on assumptions and estimates to calculate certain of our key metrics
and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics could adversely affect
our reputation and our business.

Certain of the metrics that we disclose are calculated using internal
company data that has not been independently verified or data from third-
party attribution partners. While these metrics and figures are based on
what we believe to be reasonable calculations for the applicable period of
measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring these metrics and
figures across our worldwide client base and user base. We regularly review
and may adjust our processes for calculating our metrics and other figures
to improve their accuracy, but these efforts may not prove successful and we
may discover material inaccuracies. In addition, our methodology for
calculating these metrics may differ from the methodology used by other
companies to calculate similar metrics and figures. We may also discover
unexpected errors in the data that we are using that resulted from technical
or other errors. If we determine that any of our metrics or figures are not
accurate, we may be required to revise or cease reporting such metrics or
figures. Any real or perceived inaccuracies in our metrics and other figures
could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business.

Conversion of key internal systems and processes, particularly our
enterprise resource planning system, and problems with the design,
implementation, or operation of these systems and processes could interfere
with, and therefore adversely affect, our business and operations.
                                     67                                     
Table of contents
We converted certain key internal business systems and processes, including
our enterprise resource planning system, to a cloud-based system. We have
invested, and will continue to invest, significant capital and human
resources in the design, implementation, and operation of these business
systems and processes. Any problems in the functioning of these systems or
processes, particularly any that impact our operations, could adversely
affect our ability to process payments, record and transfer information in a
timely and accurate manner, recognize revenue, file SEC reports in a timely
manner, or otherwise run our business and could adversely affect our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our
goodwill becomes impaired.

We are required under GAAP to review our goodwill for impairment at least
annually or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate
the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that may be considered a
change in circumstances, indicating a requirement to reevaluate whether our
goodwill continues to be recoverable, include a significant decline in the
market price of our Class A common stock and our market capitalization,
slower growth rates in our industry, underperformance of certain assets, or
other materially adverse events. We may be required to record a significant
charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which
any impairment of our goodwill is determined.

We have substantial indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities
and our obligations thereunder may limit our operational flexibility or
otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.

We are party to a credit agreement that provides for senior secured credit
consisting of term loans and a revolving credit facility, with varying
maturity dates through 2028. As of March 31, 2022, the aggregate principal
amount of our outstanding indebtedness under our credit facilities was $3.27
billion. There can be no assurance that we will be able to repay this
indebtedness when due, or that we will be able to refinance this
indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all.

Our indebtedness could adversely impact us. For example, these obligations
could among other things:

• make it difficult for us to pay other obligations;

• increase our cost of borrowing;

• make it difficult to obtain favorable terms for any necessary future
financing for working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions
and partnerships, debt service requirements, or other purposes;

• restrict us from making strategic acquisitions and partnerships or cause
us to make divestitures or similar transactions;

• adversely affect our liquidity and result in a material adverse effect on
our financial condition upon repayment of the indebtedness;

• require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from
operations to service and repay the indebtedness, reducing the amount of
cash flow available for other purposes;

• increase our vulnerability to adverse and economic conditions;

• increase our exposure to interest rate risk from variable rate
indebtedness;

• place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged
competitors; and

• limit our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our
business.

In addition, from time to time we have entered into interest rate swap
instruments to limit our exposure to changes in variable interest rates.
While our hedging strategy is designed to minimize the impact of increases
in interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt, including our credit
facility, there can be no guarantee that our hedging strategy will be
effective, and we may experience credit-related losses in some
circumstances.

Our credit agreement also imposes restrictions on us and requires us to
maintain compliance with specified covenants. Our ability to comply with
these covenants may be affected by market, economic, financial, competitive,
legislative, and regulatory factors, as well as other factors that are
beyond our control. A breach of any of the covenants in the credit agreement
governing our credit facilities could result in an event of default, which,
if not cured or waived, could trigger acceleration of our indebtedness and
an increase in the interest rates applicable to such indebtedness, and may
result in the acceleration of or default under any other debt we may incur
in the future to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision
applies. In addition, we have granted a security interest in a significant
portion of our assets to secure our obligations under our credit facility.
During the existence of an event of
                                     68                                     
Table of contents
default under our credit agreement, the applicable lenders could exercise
their rights and remedies thereunder, including by way of initiating
foreclosure proceedings against any assets constituting collateral for our
obligations under the credit facility. The acceleration of the indebtedness
under our credit agreement or under any other indebtedness could have a
material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and
results of operations.

We may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our significant
debt service obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt
obligations depends on our financial condition and results of operations,
which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to
certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory, and other factors
beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows
from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal,
premium, if any, or interest on our indebtedness. If our cash flows and
capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we
may be forced to reduce or delay strategic acquisitions and partnerships,
capital expenditures, and payments on account of other obligations, seek
additional capital, restructure or refinance our indebtedness, or sell
assets. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit
us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our ability to
restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the
capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of
our debt could be at higher interest rates and could require us to comply
with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business
operations. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to
refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at
all.

If we are unable to repay or otherwise refinance our indebtedness when due,
or if any other event of default is not cured or waived, the applicable
lenders could accelerate our outstanding obligations or proceed against the
collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness, which could force us
into bankruptcy or liquidation. In the event the applicable lenders
accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not
have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. Any acceleration of
amounts due under the agreements governing our credit facility or the
exercise by the applicable lenders of their rights under the security
documents could have a material and adverse effect on our business.

We may require additional capital to meet our financial obligations and
support business growth, and this capital may not be available on acceptable
terms or at all.

We intend to continue to make significant investments to support our
business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business
challenges, including the need to continue to develop our Core Technology
and Software Platform, enhance our existing Apps and develop new Apps and
features, improve our operating infrastructure, or enter into strategic
acquisitions and partnerships. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity,
equity-linked, or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise
additional funds through future issuances of equity or convertible debt
securities, our existing stockholders could experience significant dilution,
and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and
privileges superior to those of holders of our Class A common stock. Any
debt financing that we secure in the future could involve offering
additional security interests and undertaking restrictive covenants relating
to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational
matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional
capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential
acquisitions. Our credit agreement, which provides for a term loan and
revolving credit facility, contains financial covenants with which we must
comply. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable
to us, if at all. Additionally, if we seek to access additional capital or
increase our borrowing, there can be no assurance that financing and credit
may be available on favorable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain
adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require
it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to
business challenges could be significantly impaired, and our business,
financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely affected.

The London Interbank Offered Rate calculation method may change and LIBOR is
expected to be phased out after 2023.

Interest on our term loan and revolving credit facility, which are scheduled
to mature in 2028, may be calculated based on the London Interbank Offered
Rate ("LIBOR"). LIBOR is the subject of national, international and other
regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. On July 27, 2017, the U.K.’s
Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that administers LIBOR) announced
that it intends to phase out LIBOR by June of 2023. The United States
Federal Reserve has also advised banks to cease entering into new contracts
that use USD LIBOR as a reference rate. It is unclear whether new methods of
calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to
                                     69

exist after June of 2023, or if alternative rates or benchmarks will be
adopted. The Alternative Reference Rate Committee, a committee convened by
the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has
identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"), a new index
calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury
securities, as its preferred alternative rate for LIBOR. At this time, it is
not possible to predict how markets will respond to SOFR or other
alternative reference rates as the transition away from the LIBOR benchmarks
is anticipated in coming years. Accordingly, the outcome of these reforms is
uncertain and any changes in the methods by which LIBOR is determined or
regulatory activity related to LIBOR's phaseout could cause LIBOR to perform
differently than in the past or cease to exist. This could materially and
adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity. We
cannot predict the effect of the potential changes to LIBOR or the
establishment and use of alternative rates or benchmarks, including SOFR. We
may need to renegotiate our credit facility or incur other indebtedness, and
changes in the method of calculating LIBOR, or the use of an alternative
rate or benchmark, including SOFR, may negatively impact the terms of such
renegotiated credit facility or such other indebtedness. If changes are made
to the method of calculating LIBOR or LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to
amend certain contracts and cannot predict what alternative rate or
benchmark would be negotiated. This may result in an increase to our
interest expense.
Risks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock and Governance
The multi-class structure of our common stock and the Voting Agreement among
the Voting Agreement Parties have the effect of concentrating voting power
with the Voting Agreement Parties, which will limit your ability to
influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval,
including the election of our board of directors, the adoption of amendments
to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and the approval of any
merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or
other major corporate transaction.

We have three classes of common stock. Our Class A common stock has one vote
per share, our Class B common stock has 20 votes per share, and our Class C
common stock has no voting rights, except as otherwise required by law. Adam
Foroughi, our co-founder, CEO, and Chairperson; Herald Chen, our President
and Chief Financial Officer, and a member of our board of directors; and KKR
Denali Holdings L.P. (collectively with certain affiliates, the "Voting
Agreement Parties") together hold all of the issued and outstanding shares
of our Class B common stock. As of March 31, 2022, the Voting Agreement
Parties collectively held approximately 88% of the voting power of our
outstanding capital stock in the aggregate. This voting power includes
shares of Class A common stock deemed beneficially owned in accordance with
Rule 13d-3(d)(1) under the Exchange Act. The Voting Agreement Parties have
entered into a voting agreement (the "Voting Agreement") whereby all Class B
common stock held by the Voting Agreement Parties and their respective
permitted entities and permitted transferees will be voted as determined by
two of Mr. Foroughi, Mr. Chen, and KKR Denali Holdings L.P. (one of which
must be Mr. Foroughi). As a result, the Voting Agreement Parties will
collectively be able to determine or significantly influence any action
requiring the approval of our stockholders, including the election of our
board of directors, the adoption of amendments to our certificate of
incorporation and bylaws, and the approval of any merger, consolidation,
sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate
transaction. The Voting Agreement Parties may have interests that differ
from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree, and which may be
adverse to your interests. This concentrated control may have the effect of
delaying, preventing, or deterring a change in control of our company, could
deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their
capital stock as part of a sale of our company, and might ultimately affect
the market price of our Class A common stock.

Future transfers by the holders of Class B common stock will generally
result in those shares automatically converting into shares of Class A
common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers
effected for estate planning, transfers among affiliates, of KKR Denali
Holdings L.P., or other transfers among the Voting Agreement Parties. In
addition, each share of Class B common stock will convert automatically into
one share of Class A common stock upon certain events specified in our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation.

In addition, because our Class C common stock carries no voting rights
(except as otherwise required by law), if we issue Class C common stock in
the future, the holders of Class B common stock may be able to elect all of
our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a
vote of our stockholders for a longer period of time than would be the case
if we issued Class A common stock rather than Class C common stock in such
transactions.

We are considered a “controlled company” within the meaning of the Nasdaq
corporate governance requirements, and, as a result, we qualify for, and
currently rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance
requirements.
                                     70                                     
Table of contents
As a result of our multi-class common stock structure and the Voting
Agreement among the Voting Agreement Parties, the Voting Agreement Parties
collectively hold greater than a majority of the voting power of our
outstanding capital stock and the Voting Agreement Parties have the
authority to vote the shares of all Class B common stock, subject to the
terms of the Voting Agreement, at their discretion on all matters to be
voted upon by stockholders. Therefore, we are considered a “controlled
company” as that term is set forth in the Nasdaq corporate governance
requirements. Under these corporate governance requirements, a company in
which over 50% of the voting power for the election of directors is held by
an individual, a group, or another company is a “controlled company” and may
elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements,
including:

• the requirement that a majority of its board of directors consist of
independent directors;

• the requirement that we have a nominating/corporate governance committee
that is comprised entirely of independent directors with a written charter
addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities;

• the requirement that we have a compensation committee that is comprised
entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the
committee’s purpose and responsibilities; and

• the requirement for an annual performance evaluation of the nominating and
corporate governance and compensation committees.

We currently utilize, and intend to continue to utilize, certain of these
exemptions. As a result, our compensation committee does not consist
entirely of independent directors. Accordingly, you will not have the same
protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of
the corporate governance requirements. In the event that we cease to be a
“controlled company” and our Class A common stock continues to be listed on
Nasdaq, we will be required to comply with these provisions within the
applicable transaction periods.
We cannot predict the effect our multi-class structure may have on the
market price of our Class A common stock.
We cannot predict whether our multi-class structure will result in a lower
or more volatile market price of our Class A common stock, in adverse
publicity, or other adverse consequences. For example, certain index
providers have announced restrictions on including companies with multi-
class share structures in certain of their indices. In July 2017, FTSE
Russell announced that it plans to require new constituents of its indices
to have greater than 5% of the company’s voting rights in the hands of
public stockholders, and S&P Dow Jones announced that it will no longer
admit companies with multi-class share structures to certain of its indices.
Affected indices include the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400,
and S&P SmallCap 600, which together make up the S&P Composite 1500. Also in
2017, MSCI, a leading stock index provider, opened public consultations on
their treatment of no-vote and multi-class structures and temporarily barred
new multi-class listings from certain of its indices and in October 2018,
MSCI announced its decision to include equity securities “with unequal
voting structures” in its indices and to launch a new index that
specifically includes voting rights in its eligibility criteria. Under such
announced policies, the multi-class structure of our common stock would make
us ineligible for inclusion in certain indices and, as a result, mutual
funds, exchange-traded funds, and other investment vehicles that attempt to
track those indices would not invest in our Class A common stock. These
policies are relatively new and it is unclear what effect, if any, they will
have on the valuations of publicly-traded companies excluded from such
indices, but it is possible that they may depress valuations, as compared to
similar companies that are included. Given the sustained flow of investment
funds into passive strategies that seek to track certain indices, exclusion
from certain stock indices would likely preclude investment by many of these
funds and could make our Class A common stock less attractive to other
investors. As a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could
be adversely affected.

The market price of our Class A common stock could be volatile, and you
could lose all or part of your investment.

The market price of our Class A common stock has, and may continue to,
fluctuate substantially depending on a number of factors, including those
described in this “Risk Factors” section, many of which are beyond our
control and may not be related to our operating performance. These
fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our
Class A common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the market
price of our Class A common stock include the following:

• price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to
time, including fluctuations due to general economic uncertainty or negative
market sentiment, in particular related to the COVID-19 pandemic;

• volatility in the market and trading volumes of technology stocks;
                                     71                                     
Table of contents
• changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other
technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular;

• sales of shares of our Class A common stock by us or our stockholders;

• rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our
industry;

• failure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in
financial estimates by securities analysts who follow our company, or our
failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;

• actual or perceived significant data breaches involving our Core
Technologies, Software Platform or Apps;

• the financial or non-financial metric projections we may provide to the
public, any changes in those projections or our failure to meet those
projections;

• third-party data published about us or other mobile gaming companies,
whether or not such data accurately reflects actual levels of usage;

• announcements by us or our competitors of new products or services;

• the public’s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements,
and filings with the SEC;

• fluctuations in the trading volume of shares of our Class A common stock
or the size of our public float;

• short selling of our Class A common stock or related derivative
securities;

• actual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our results of
operations;

• actual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors’
businesses, or the competitive landscape generally;

• our issuance of shares of our Class A common stock;

• litigation or regulatory action involving us, our industry or both, or
investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our
competitors;

• developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other
proprietary rights;

• announced or completed acquisitions of businesses or technologies by us or
our competitors;

• new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or
regulations applicable to our business;

• changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or
principles;

• major catastrophic events in our domestic and foreign markets;

• any significant change in our management; and

• general economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets.

In addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in
general experiences a loss of investor confidence, the market price of our
Class A common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business,
financial condition, or results of operations. The market price of our Class
A common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other
companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us.
Accordingly, we cannot assure you of the liquidity of any trading market,
your ability to sell your shares of our Class A common stock when desired,
or the prices that you may obtain for your shares of our Class A common
stock.

In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a
company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been
brought against that company. If the market price of our Class A common
stock is volatile, we may become the target of securities litigation.
Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our
management’s attention and resources from our business. Such litigation
could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.
                                     72                                     
Table of contents
We may not realize the anticipated long-term stockholder value of our share
repurchase programs and any failure to repurchase our Class A common stock
after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our
stock price.

In February 2022, we announced that our board of directors authorized the
repurchase of up to $750.0 million of our Class A common stock over time.
Under this or any other future share repurchase programs, we may make share
repurchases through a variety of methods, including open share market
purchases, block transactions or privately negotiated transactions, in
accordance with applicable federal securities laws. Our share repurchase
program has no time limit, does not obligate us to repurchase any specific
number of shares and may be suspended at any time at our discretion and
without prior notice. The timing and amount of any repurchases, if any, will
be subject to liquidity, stock price, market and economic conditions,
compliance with applicable legal requirements such as Delaware surplus and
solvency tests, compliance with our credit agreement, and other relevant
factors. Any failure to repurchase stock after we have announced our
intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation and investor
confidence in us and may negatively impact our stock price.

The existence of this share repurchase program could cause our stock price
to be higher than it otherwise would be and could potentially reduce the
market liquidity for our stock. Although this program is intended to enhance
long-term stockholder value, there is no assurance it will do so because the
market price of our Class A common stock may decline below the levels at
which we repurchased shares and short-term stock price fluctuations could
reduce the effectiveness of the program.

Repurchasing our Class A common stock will reduce the amount of cash we have
available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, strategic
acquisitions or business opportunities, and other general corporate
requirements, and we may fail to realize the anticipated long-term
stockholder value of any share repurchase programs.

Future sales of our Class A common stock could depress the market price of
our Class A common stock.

The market price of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of
sales of a large number of shares of our Class A common stock in the market,
and the perception that these sales could occur may also depress the market
price of our Class A common stock.

Certain stockholders are entitled, under our investors' rights agreement
(our "IRA"), to certain demand registration rights. In addition, we filed a
registration statement to register shares reserved for future issuance under
our equity compensation plans and a registration statement to register
shares of Class A common stock issued pursuant to our 2011 Equity Incentive
Plan for resale. As a result, subject to the satisfaction of applicable
exercise periods, the registered shares, including those issued upon
exercise of outstanding stock options, will be available for immediate
resale in the United States in the open market.

Sales of our Class A common stock as restrictions end or pursuant to
registration rights may make it more difficult for us to sell equity
securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.
These sales also could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to
fall and make it more difficult for you to sell shares of our Class A common
stock.

The issuance of additional stock in connection with financings,
acquisitions, investments, our equity incentive plans, or otherwise will
dilute all other stockholders.

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue
up to 1,500,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, up to 150,000,000 shares
of Class C common stock, and up to 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock
with such rights and preferences as may be determined by our board of
directors. Subject to compliance with applicable rules and regulations, we
may issue shares of Class A common stock or securities convertible into
shares of our Class A common stock from time to time in connection with a
financing, acquisition, investment, our equity incentive plans, or
otherwise. For example, in connection with our acquisition of Adjust in
April 2021, we issued convertible securities that converted into an
aggregate of 6,320,688 shares of our Class A common stock. Any such issuance
could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause
the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.

Our multi-class stock structure, the Voting Agreement, and other provisions
in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and
restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest
difficult, thereby depressing the market price of our Class A common stock.

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and
restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our
company more difficult, including the following:
                                     73                                     
Table of contents
• our multi-class common stock structure and the Voting Agreement, which
provide the Voting Agreement Parties with the ability to determine or
significantly influence the outcome of matters requiring stockholder
approval, even if they own significantly less than a majority of the shares
of our outstanding common stock;

• vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by our board of
directors and not by stockholders;

• a special meeting of our stockholders may only be called by a majority of
our board of directors, the chairperson of our board of directors, our Chief
Executive Officer, or our President;

• advance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates
for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of
stockholders;

• our amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not provide for
cumulative voting;

• our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes
undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and
shares of which may be issued by our board of directors, without further
action by our stockholders;

• after the first date on which the outstanding shares of our Class B common
stock represent less than a majority of the total combined voting power of
our Class A common stock and our Class B common stock (the "Voting Threshold
Date"), our stockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of
stockholders and will not be able to take action by written consent for any
matter; and

• certain litigation against us may only be brought in Delaware.

These provisions, alone or together, could discourage, delay, or prevent a
transaction involving a change in control of our company. These provisions
could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for
stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take
other corporate actions they desire, any of which, under certain
circumstances, could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a
premium for their shares of our Class A common stock, and could also affect
the market price of our Class A common stock.

Our amended and restated bylaws designate a state or federal court located
within the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United
States as the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and
our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to choose the
judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or
employees.

Our amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing
to the selection of an alternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or
proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of
breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, or other
employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action arising pursuant to
any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and
restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws,
or (iv) any other action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal
affairs doctrine shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
(or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal
district court for the District of Delaware), in all cases subject to the
court having jurisdiction over indispensable parties named as defendants,
and provided that this exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits
brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act.

Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal
and state courts over all such Securities Act actions. Accordingly, both
state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. To
prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat
of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different courts, among other
considerations, our amended and restated bylaws also provide that the
federal district courts of the United States of America will be the
exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action
arising under the Securities Act. However, while the Delaware Supreme Court
ruled in March 2020 that federal forum selection provisions purporting to
require claims under the Securities Act be brought in federal court are
“facially valid” under Delaware law, there is uncertainty as to whether
other courts will enforce our federal forum provision. If the federal forum
provision is found to be unenforceable, we may incur additional costs
associated with resolving such matters.

Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding or owning
(or continuing to hold or own) any interest in any of our securities shall
be deemed to have notice of and consented to the foregoing bylaw provisions.
Although we believe these exclusive forum provisions benefit us by providing
increased consistency in the application of Delaware law and federal
securities laws in the types of lawsuits to which each applies, the
exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a
claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with
                                     74                                     
Table of contents
us or any of our directors, officers, stockholders, or other employees,
which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims against us and our
current and former directors, officers, stockholders, or other employees.
Our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the
federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder as a result
of our exclusive forum provisions. Further, in the event a court finds
either exclusive forum provision contained in our amended and restated
bylaws to be unenforceable or inapplicable in an action, we may incur
additional costs associated with resolving such action in other
jurisdictions, which could harm our results of operations.

During the three months ended March 31, 2022, we issued RSUs covering
125,255 shares of our Class A common stock under our 2021 Partner Studio
Incentive Plan. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, we issued
23,113 shares of our Class A common stock upon the vesting and settlement of
RSUs issued under our 2021 Partner Studio Incentive Plan.

The foregoing transactions did not involve any underwriters, any
underwriting discounts or commissions, or any public offering. We believe
the offer, sale, and issuance of the above securities was exempt from
registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”) by
virtue of Section 4(a)(2) of the Act and Regulation S promulgated under the
Act, because the issuance of securities to the recipients did not involve a
public offering. The recipients of the securities in the transaction
represented their intentions to acquire the securities for investment only
and not with a view to or for sale in connection with any distribution
thereof, and appropriate legends were placed upon the stock certificates
issued in the transaction. All recipients had adequate access, through their
relationships with us or otherwise, to information about us. The issuance of
these securities was made without any general solicitation or advertising.

of up to $750.0 million of our Class A common stock. Repurchases may be made
from time to time through open market purchases or through privately
negotiated transactions, subject to market conditions, applicable legal
requirements and other relevant factors. Open market repurchases may be
structured to occur in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18. We
may also, from time to time, enter into Rule 10b-5 trading plans to
facilitate repurchases of its shares. The repurchase program does not
obligate us to acquire any particular amount of our Class A common stock,
has no expiration date and may be modified, suspended or terminated at any
time at our discretion.

repurchases.
