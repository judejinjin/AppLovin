This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking
statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, which

forward-looking statements because they contain words such as
“may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “could,”
“intend,” “target,” “project,” “contemplate,” “believe,”
“estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue” or the negative

We caution you that the foregoing list may not contain all of the
forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q.

You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions
of future events. We have based the forward-looking statements
contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q primarily on our
current expectations and projections about future events and trends
that we believe may affect our business, financial condition,
results of operations, and prospects. The outcome of the events
described in these forward-looking statements is subject to
                                 1

risks, uncertainties, and other factors, including those described
in the section titled “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Moreover, we operate in a very
competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and
uncertainties emerge from time to time and it is not possible for
us to predict all risks and uncertainties that could have an impact
on the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q. We cannot assure you that the results, events,
and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will
be achieved or occur, and actual results, events, or circumstances
could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking
statements.

Neither we nor any other person assumes responsibility for the
accuracy and completeness of any of these forward-looking
statements. Moreover, the forward-looking statements made in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q relate only to events as of the date
on which the statements are made. We undertake no obligation to
update any forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q to reflect events or circumstances after the date of
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or to reflect new information or
the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law.
We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions, or expectations
disclosed in our forward-looking statements and you should not
place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Our
forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of
any future acquisitions, partnerships, mergers, dispositions, joint
ventures, or investments we may make.

In addition, statements that “we believe” and similar statements
reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These
statements are based upon information available to us as of the
date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and while we believe
such information forms a reasonable basis for such statements, such
information may be limited or incomplete, and our statements should
not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive
inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant
information. These statements are inherently uncertain and
investors are cautioned not to unduly rely upon these statements.

1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies

Description of Business
AppLovin Corporation (the “Company” or “AppLovin”) was incorporated
in the state of Delaware on July 18, 2011. The Company is a leader
in the advertising ecosystem providing end-to-end Advertising
solutions that allow businesses to reach, monetize and grow their
global audiences. The Company also has a globally diversified
portfolio of apps—free-to-play mobile games that it operates
through its owned or partner studios.

The Company is headquartered in Palo Alto, California, and has
several operating locations in the U.S. as well as various
international office locations in North America, Asia, and Europe.
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for
interim financial reporting. Certain information and footnote
disclosures normally included in the financial statements prepared
in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to
such rules and regulations. Therefore, the unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes
included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the
SEC on February 27, 2025. The condensed consolidated balance sheet
data as of December 31, 2024 was derived from the audited
consolidated financial statements at that date but does not include
all disclosures required by GAAP. The accompanying unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all normal and
recurring adjustments, that are, in the opinion of management,
necessary for the fair presentation of the Company’s financial
position, results of operations, cash flows and stockholders’
equity for the interim periods presented. The results of operations
for the three months ended March 31, 2025 shown in this report are
not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the
full year ending December 31, 2025 or any other period.
Certain prior period amounts reported in the Company's condensed
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been
reclassified to conform to current period presentation.
Basis of Consolidation
The Company's condensed consolidated financial statements include
accounts and operations of the Company and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries. In accordance with the provisions of Accounting
Standards Codification ("ASC") 810, Consolidation , the Company is
also required to consolidate any variable interest entities ("VIE")
when it is the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary has
both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most
significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and the
obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be
significant to the VIE, or the right to receive benefits from the
VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The Company
evaluates its relationships with all VIEs on an ongoing basis. All
intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon
consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the Company's condensed consolidated financial
statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and
disclosed in the condensed consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes. The Company bases its estimates on assumptions
that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an
ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including, but
not limited to, those related to fair values of assets and
liabilities acquired through acquisitions, useful lives of
intangible assets and property and equipment, expected period of
consumption of virtual goods, income and indirect taxes, contingent
liabilities, evaluation of recoverability of intangible assets and
long-lived assets, goodwill impairment, stock-based compensation,
fair value of financial instruments. These estimates are inherently
subject to judgment and actual results could differ materially from
those estimates.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements (Issued Not Yet Adopted)
In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the
"FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2023-09,
Income Taxes: Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures , which
requires disaggregation of rate reconciliation categories and
income taxes paid by jurisdiction. The amendments will be
                                 9                                 
Table of C ontents
effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The
amendments may be applied prospectively or retrospectively, and
early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating
this ASU to determine its impact on the Company's disclosures.

In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement:
Reporting Comprehensive Income-Expense Disaggregation Disclosures ,
which requires disaggregated disclosures, in the notes to the
financial statements, of certain categories of expenses that are
included in expense line items on the face of the income statement.
The amendments will be effective for annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2026, and interim periods beginning after December 15,
2027. The amendments may be applied prospectively or
retrospectively, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is
currently evaluating this ASU to determine its impact on the
Company's disclosures.
                                                                   
  2. Revenue                                                       
                                                                   
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
The Company generates Advertising and Apps Revenue. Advertising
Revenue is generated primarily from fees collected from advertisers
including advertising networks who use the Advertising solutions.
Apps Revenue consists of in-app purchase revenue ("IAP Revenue")
generated from in-app purchases made by users within the Company’s
apps (“Apps”), and in-app advertising revenue ("IAA Revenue")
generated from third-party advertisers that purchase ad inventory
from Apps.
Advertising Revenue
The vast majority of the Advertising Revenue is generated through
AppDiscovery and MAX, which provide the technology to match
advertisers and owners of digital advertising inventory
(“Publishers”) via auctions at large scale and microsecond-level
speeds. The terms for all mobile advertising arrangements are
governed by the Company’s terms and conditions and generally
stipulate payment terms of 30 days subsequent to the end of the
month. Substantially all of the Company's contracts with customers
are fully cancelable at any time or upon a short notice.
The Company’s performance obligation is to provide customers with
access to the Advertising solutions, which facilitates the
advertiser’s purchase of ad inventory from Publishers. The Company
does not control the ad inventory prior to its transfer to the
advertiser, because the Company does not have the substantive
ability to direct the use of nor obtain substantially all of the
remaining benefits from the ad inventory. The Company is not
primarily responsible for fulfillment. The Company is an agent as
it relates to the sale of third-party advertising inventory and
presents revenue on a net basis. The transaction price is the
product of either the number of completions of agreed upon actions
or advertisements displayed and the contractually agreed upon price
per advertising unit with the advertiser less consideration paid or
payable to Publishers. The Company recognizes Advertising Revenue
when the agreed upon action is completed or when the ad is
displayed to users. The number of advertisements delivered and
completions of agreed upon actions is determined at the end of each
month, which resolves any uncertainty in the transaction price
during the reporting period.
Advertising Revenue also includes revenue generated from Adjust's
measurement and analytics marketing platform that is recognized
ratably over the subscription period of generally up to twelve
months. Revenue from other services was not material.
Apps Revenue
In-App Purchase Revenue
IAP Revenue includes fees collected from users to purchase virtual
goods to enhance their gameplay experience. The identified
performance obligation is to provide users with the ability to
acquire, use, and hold virtual items over the estimated period of
time the virtual items are available to the user or until the
virtual item is consumed. Payment is required at the time of
purchase, and the purchase price is a fixed amount.
Users make IAPs through the Company’s distribution partners. The
transaction price is equal to the gross amount charged to users
because the Company is the principal in the transaction. IAP fees
are non-refundable. Such payments are initially recorded as
deferred revenue. The Company categorizes its virtual goods as
either consumable or durable. Consumable virtual goods represent
goods that can be consumed by a specific player action in gameplay;
accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue from the sale of
consumable virtual goods as the goods are consumed. Durable virtual
goods represent goods that are accessible to the user over an
extended period of time; accordingly, the Company recognizes
revenue from the sale of durable virtual goods ratably over the
period of time the goods are available to the user, which is
generally the estimated average user life (“EAUL”).
The EAUL represents the Company’s best estimate of the expected
life of paying users for the applicable
                                10                                 
Table of C ontents
game. The EAUL begins when a user makes the first purchase of
durable virtual goods and ends when a user is determined to be
inactive. The Company determines the EAUL on a game-by-game basis.
For a newly launched game with limited playing data, the Company
determines its EAUL based on the EAUL of a game with sufficiently
similar characteristics.

The Company determines the EAUL on a quarterly basis and applies
such calculated EAUL to all bookings in the respective quarter.
Determining the EAUL is subjective and requires management’s
judgment. Future playing patterns may differ from historical
playing patterns, and therefore the EAUL may change in the future.
The EAULs are generally between fiveand ten months.
In-App Advertising Revenue
IAA Revenue is generated by selling ad inventory on the Company's
Apps to third-party advertisers. Advertisers purchase ad inventory
either through the Advertising solutions or through third-party
advertising networks (“Ad Networks”). Revenue from the sale of ad
inventory through Ad Networks is recognized net of the amounts
retained by Ad Networks as the Company is unable to determine the
gross amount paid by the advertisers to Ad Networks. The Company
recognizes revenue when the ad is displayed to users.

The Company presents taxes collected from customers and remitted to
governmental authorities on a net basis.

type (in thousands):

Contract Balances
Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue, which are
recorded for payments received in advance of the satisfaction of
performance obligations. During the three months ended March 31,
2025 and 2024, the Company recognized $ 47.8million and $
53.0million of revenue that was included in deferred revenue as of
December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Unsatisfied Performance Obligations
Substantially all of the Company’s unsatisfied performance
obligations relate to contracts with an original expected length of
one year or less.
                                                                   
   3. Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements            
                                                                   
Financial Instruments Measured at Fair Value by Level on a
Recurring Basis

As of December 31, 2024, the Company held $ 41.5million in money
market deposit accounts, which were included in cash and cash
equivalents and classified as Level 1 within the fair value
hierarchy. The balance of such accounts was notmaterial as of March
31, 2025.

Non-Marketable Equity Securities Measured at Net Asset Value

The Company held equity interests in certain private equity funds
of $ 97.7million and $ 77.3million as of March 31, 2025 and
December 31, 2024, respectively, which are measured using the net
asset value practical expedient. Under the net asset value
practical expedient, the Company records investments based on the
                                11                                 
Table of C ontents
proportionate share of the underlying funds’ net asset value as of
the Company's reporting date. These investments are included in
other assets in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance
sheets.

These funds vary in investment strategies and generally have an
initial term of 7to 10years, which may be extended for 2to
3additional years with the applicable approval. These investments
are subject to certain restrictions regarding transfers and
withdrawals and generally cannot be redeemed with the funds.
Distributions from the funds will be received as the underlying
investments are liquidated. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss
is limited to the carrying value of these investments of $
97.7million and the unfunded commitments of $ 3.0million as of
March 31, 2025.

During the three months ended March 31, 2025, the Company made
total capital contributions of $ 18.7million related to these
investments. The Company recognized immaterial unrealized gains
related to these investments for the three months ended March 31,
2025 and 2024.

Non-Marketable Equity Securities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-
Recurring Basis

The Company's non-marketable equity securities are investments in
privately held companies without readily determinable fair values.
The Company elected the measurement alternative to account for
these investments. Under the measurement alternative, the carrying
value of the non-marketable equity securities are adjusted based on
price changes from observable transactions of identical or similar
securities of the same issuer or for impairment. Any changes in
carrying value are recorded within other income, net in the
Company's condensed consolidated statement of operations.

As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the carrying amounts of
the Company's non-marketable equity securities were $ 68.1million
and $ 68.1million, respectively, and were included in other assets
in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets. Since
acquisition, the Company had recorded a cumulative impairment
charge of $ 28.0million related to these investments.
                                                                   
  4. Commitments and Contingencies                                 
                                                                   
Commitments

As of March 31, 2025, the Company's non-cancelable minimum purchase
commitments were primarily related to a multi-year contractual
arrangement with a cloud services provider. In August 2024, the
Company amended its agreement with the provider, committing to
spend a minimum of $ 1.3billion over a three-yearperiod. By March
31, 2025, the Company had made cumulative payments of $
228.8million towards this commitment.

Contingencies

From time to time, the Company may have certain contingent
liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of business
activities. The Company accrues a liability for such matters when
it is probable that future expenditures will be made, and such
expenditures can be reasonably estimated.

Letters of Credit

As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the Company had
outstanding letters of credit in the aggregate amount of $
6.3million and $ 6.3million, respectively, which were issued as
security for certain leased office facilities under the Credit
Agreement. These letters of credit have never been drawn upon.
Legal Proceedings
The Company is involved from time to time in litigation, claims,
and proceedings. The outcomes of the Company’s legal proceedings
are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant
uncertainty, and could, either individually or in aggregate, have a
material adverse effect.

The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has
been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If it is
determined that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range
of loss can be estimated, the reasonably possible loss is
disclosed. The Company evaluates developments in legal matters that
could affect the amount of liability that has been previously
accrued, and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and
makes adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required
to determine the likelihood of matters and the estimated amount of
a loss related to such matters. To date, losses in connection with
legal proceedings have not been material.

The Company expenses legal fees in the period in which they are
incurred.

Indemnifications
The Company enters into indemnification provisions under agreements
with other parties in the ordinary course of business, including
certain customers, business partners, investors, contractors and
the Company’s officers, directors and certain employees. It is not
possible to determine the maximum potential loss under these
indemnification provisions due to the Company’s limited history of
prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances
involved in each particular provision. To date, losses recorded in
the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of operations in
connection with the indemnification provisions have not been
material. As of March 31, 2025, the Company did not have any
material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably
possible.
Non-income Taxes
The Company may be subject to audit by various tax authorities with
regard to non-income tax matters. The subject matter of non-income
tax audits primarily arises from different interpretations on tax
treatment and tax rates applied. The Company accrues liabilities
for non-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any
negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when a loss is
probable and reasonably estimable. If a loss is reasonably possible
and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, the Company
discloses the reasonably possible loss.

The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit
level on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes
in circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired.

On February 12, 2025, the Company entered into a non-binding term
sheet to sell its mobile gaming business to Tripledot, a privately
held company. On May 7, 2025, the Company and certain of its
subsidiaries entered into a definitive agreement with Tripledot and
its affiliates to sell the Company’s mobile gaming business for
total consideration consisting of $ 150.0million in cash, a $
250.0million secured promissory note, and equity representing
approximately 20% of Tripledot’s fully diluted equity
capitalization at closing, subject to customary purchase price
adjustments. The closing of the transaction is subject to
regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.

The Company identified the non-binding term sheet combined with
negotiations throughout the first quarter of 2025 to sell the
mobile gaming business as an indicator of impairment for the Apps
reporting unit and performed an interim quantitative goodwill
impairment test as of March 31, 2025. Based on this assessment, the
Company determined that the carrying amount of the Apps reporting
unit exceeded its estimated fair value and recorded a non-cash
goodwill impairment charge of $ 188.9million in its condensed
consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended
March 31, 2025.

At the time the interim impairment test was performed, the Company
had not yet determined the fair value of the total consideration,
which is subject to a valuation of the equity consideration at the
closing of the transaction. As a result, the Company estimated the
fair value of the Apps reporting unit using the discounted cash
flow method of the income approach. Key valuation inputs included
projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates and long-
term growth rates, which are based on management’s estimates and
assumptions believed to be reasonable and reflective of known
market conditions as of the interim impairment test date. The
resulting fair value measurement is classified as Level 3 within
the fair value hierarchy due to the use of significant unobservable
inputs.

Upon closing, the Company will recognize a gain or loss on the sale
of the mobile gaming business based on the difference between the
total fair value of the consideration received, including the
equity consideration, and the carrying amount of the mobile gaming
business’s net assets.

In February 2022, the Company's board of directors authorized a
stock repurchase program for the Company's Class A common stock. As
of December 31, 2024, $ 2.3billion remained available for
repurchases under the program. During the three months ended March
31, 2025, the Company repurchased and subsequently retired
2,931,609shares of Class A common stock for an aggregate amount,
including commissions and fees, of $ 1.0billion. As of March 31,
2025, $ 1.3billion remained available for repurchases under the
program.

Repurchases may be made from time to time through open market
purchases or through privately negotiated transactions, subject to
market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant
factors. Open market repurchases may be structured to occur in
accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). The Company
may also, from time to time, enter into Rule 10b-5 trading plans,
to facilitate repurchases of shares. The repurchase program does
not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of Class
A common stock, has no expiration date and may be modified,
suspended, or terminated at any time at the Company's discretion.

The Company retires its Class A common stock upon repurchases, and
records the excess of repurchase price over par value for shares
repurchased to retained earnings to the extent the Company has
retained earnings. If the Company has an accumulated deficit, the
Company records the excess of repurchase price over par value for
shares repurchased first to additional paid-in capital, to the
extent the Company has additional paid-in capital, until depleted,
and then to accumulated deficit in the Company’s consolidated
statements of redeemable noncontrolling interest and stockholders’
equity.

The Company maintains threeequity compensation plans that provide
for the issuance of shares of its common stock to the Company’s
employees, directors, consultants and other service providers: the
2021 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2021 Plan"), the 2021 Partner
Studio Incentive Plan, and the 2021 Employee Stock Purchase. There
were no material equity award issuances during the three months
ended March 31, 2025.

  8. Earnings Per Share                                            
                                                                   
The rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the
holders of Class A and Class B common stock are identical, except
with respect to voting and conversion. Each share of Class A common
stock is entitled to onevote per share and each share of Class B
common stock is entitled to 20votes per share. Each share of Class
B common stock is convertible into one share of Class A common
stock voluntarily at any time by the holder, and automatically upon
certain events. The Class A common stock has no conversion rights.
As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical for Class A
and Class B common stock, the undistributed earnings are allocated
on a proportional basis and the resulting net income per share
attributable to common stockholders will, therefore, be the same
for both Class A and Class B common stock on an individual or
combined basis.
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted
net income per share attributable to common stockholders (in
thousands, except share and per share data):

  9. Income Taxes                                                  
                                                                   
The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in foreign
jurisdictions. The Company bases the interim tax accruals on an
estimated annual effective tax rate applied to year-to-date income
and records the discrete tax items in the period to which they
relate. Each quarter, the Company updates the estimated annual
effective tax rate and makes a year-to-date adjustment to the tax
provision as necessary. The Company’s calendar year 2025 annual
effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate primarily
due to jurisdictional mix of earnings, global minimum tax, foreign
tax credits, foreign derived intangible income deduction, and
global intangible low-taxed income.

During the three months ended March 31, 2025, there were no
material changes to the Company's unrecognized tax benefits, and
the Company does not expect material changes in unrecognized tax
benefits within the next twelve months.
                                                                   
  10. Segments                                                     
                                                                   
The Company determines its operating segments based on how its
chief operating decision maker ("CODM") manages the business,
allocates resources, makes operating decisions and evaluates
operating performance. The Company’s CODM is the Chief Executive
Officer. The Company's twooperating and reportable segments are as
follows:

• Advertising : Revenue is generated primarily from fees paid by
advertisers for the placement of ads on mobile applications owned
by Publishers.

• Apps : Revenue is generated when a user of one of the Apps makes
an in-app purchase ("IAP Revenue") and when clients purchase the
digital advertising inventory of the Company's portfolio of Apps
("IAA Revenue").

The CODM evaluates the performance of each operating segment using
revenue and segment Adjusted EBITDA. The Company defines segment
Adjusted EBITDA as revenue less expenses, excluding depreciation
and amortization and certain items that the Company does not
believe are reflective of the operating segments’ core operations.
Expenses include indirect costs that are allocated to operating
segments based on a reasonable allocation methodology, which are
generally related to sales and marketing activities and general and
administrative overhead. Revenue and expenses exclude transactions
between the Company's operating segments.

The CODM uses segment Adjusted EBITDA to allocate resources during
the annual budgeting and forecasting process. The CODM considers
segment Adjusted EBITDA when making decisions on operating and
capital resource allocation. Additionally, the CODM uses segment
Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate operating strategy and assess segment
performance by comparing the results of each segment.

The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using asset
information, and, accordingly, the Company does not report asset
information by segment.

related to the Advertising segment and $ 3.3million related to the
Apps segment. These charges primarily consisted of one-time
termination benefits and stock-based compensation expenses
recognized due to the accelerated vesting of equity awards in
connection with employee terminations.

As of March 31, 2025, unpaid liabilities related to one-time
termination benefits were $ 1.5million. The Company did notincur
restructuring costs during the three months ended March 31, 2024.

In February 2024, the Company entered into an underwriting
agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) with KKR Denali, and BofA
Securities, Inc., acting for themselves and as representative of
other underwriters

(collectively, the “Underwriters”), in connection with a secondary
public offering (the “Offering”) of 19,866,397shares of the
Company's Class A common stock by KKR Denali. Pursuant to the
Underwriting Agreement, on March 6, 2024, the Company repurchased
from the Underwriters 10,466,397shares of Class A common stock sold
to the Underwriters by KKR Denali in the O ffering at a price per
share of $ 54.46, the same per share price paid by the Underwriters
to KKR Denali in the Offering. In connection with the Offering, KKR
Denali converted 16,000,000shares of Class B common stock to Class
A common stock.

In February 2024, the Company entered into an agreement to invest $
50.0million in the Series C preferred stock financing of Humans,
Inc., the developer of the Flip Shop social shopping app ("Flip
Shop"). In February 2024, the Company also entered into an arm's
length commercial agreement with Humans, Inc. related to its use of
the Company's advertising recommendation engine, AXON, under a
revenue share model. No transactions have occurred to date under
this commercial agreement. Eduardo Vivas, a member the Company's
board of directors, serves as the Chief Operating Officer of
Humans, Inc., and a member of its board of directors.

During the three months ended March 31, 2025, the Company
recognized $ 0.4million in Advertising Revenue from Humans, Inc.
related to their use of the Company’s Advertising solutions. The
transactions were conducted at arm’s-length pricing and under
standard contractual terms.

In March 2019, the Company entered into a promissory note with
Rafael Vivas, the brother of Eduardo Vivas, a member of the
Company's board of directors, for the purpose of advancing him
funds to allow him to early exercise his stock options (“Vivas
Note”). The Vivas Note was issued in the amount of $ 2.3million at
an interest rate of 2.59%, and later amended on August 7, 2020 to
lower the interest rate on the outstanding balance of such note to
the then applicable IRS annual mid-term rate of 0.41%. On March 8,
2024, the principal amount due under the Vivas Note plus accrued
interest, or $ 2.3million, was repaid in full to the Company and
the Vivas Note was extinguished.

The Company had no other material related party transactions for
the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024.

On May 7, 2025, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered
into a definitive agreement with Tripledot and its affiliates to
sell the Company’s mobile gaming business for total consideration
consisting of $ 150.0million in cash, a $ 250.0million secured
promissory note, and equity representing approximately 20% of
Tripledot’s fully diluted equity capitalization at closing, subject
to customary purchase price adjustments. The closing of the
transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary
closing conditions.

The Company determined that the pending sale constitutes the
disposal of substantially all of its Apps segment and represents a
strategic shift that will have a major effect on its operations and
financial results. Accordingly, the Company concluded that the Apps
segment meets the criteria for classification as a discontinued
operation under ASC 205-20, and will reflect the results of the
Apps segment as a discontinued operation beginning in the second
quarter of 2025.

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition
and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our
condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes
included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-
looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Factors
that could cause or contribute to such differences include those
identified below and those discussed in the section titled “Risk
Factors” and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our
historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results
that may be expected for any period in the future.
                                                                   
   Overview                                                        
                                                                   
Our mission is to create meaningful connections between companies
and their ideal customers. We provide end-to-end software and AI-
powered solutions for businesses to reach, monetize and grow their
global audience. We also operate a portfolio of owned mobile apps
and accelerated our market penetration through an active
acquisition and partnership strategy. Our scaled business model is
intricately linked to the advertising ecosystem, providing a
durable competitive advantage. We generate revenue when our
advertisers achieve their return on ad spend targets with our
Advertising solutions, ensuring that their success directly fuels
our growth.

Since our founding in 2011, we have been focused on building
Advertising solutions for advertisers to improve the marketing and
monetization of their content. Our founders, who were mobile app
developers themselves, quickly realized the real impediment to
success and growth in the advertising ecosystem was a discovery and
monetization problem—breaking through the congested app stores to
efficiently find users and successfully grow their business. Their
first-hand experience with these challenges led to the development
of our infrastructure and Advertising solutions. We capitalized on
our success and understanding of the mobile app ecosystem by
entering into the mobile game apps industry in 2018. Our global
diversified portfolio of apps now consist of over 200 free-to-play
mobile games across five genres, run by ten studios.

For the three months ended March 31, 2025, our revenue increased
40% year-over-year to $1.5 billion, from $1.1 billion in the three
months ended March 31, 2024. We generated net income of $576.4
million and $236.2 million for the three months ended March 31,
2025 and 2024, respectively. We generated Adjusted EBITDA of $1.0
billion and $548.8 million for the three months ended March 31,
2025 and 2024, respectively. Additionally, our net cash provided by
operating activities was $831.7 million and $392.8 million in the
three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. We
generated Free Cash Flow of $825.7 million and $387.6 million for
the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Given
our strong financial position, we have been able to reinvest in our
expansion and growth, and repurchase and withhold shares of our
Class A common stock. See the section titled “Non-GAAP Financial
Measures” for a definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation
of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable
financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP.
                                                                   
   Our Business Model                                              
                                                                   
We collect revenue from Advertising and our Apps. During the three
months ended March 31, 2025, Advertising Revenue represented 78% of
total revenue and Apps Revenue represented 22% of total revenue.

We report our operating results through two reportable segments:
Advertising and Apps.

Our CODM, the Chief Executive Officer, evaluates performance of
each segment based on several factors, of which the financial
measures are segment revenue and segment adjusted EBITDA, as
defined in Note 10 to our condensed consolidated financial
statements.

The Advertising and Apps segments provide a view into the
organization of our business and generate revenue as follows:
                                                                   
  Advertising Revenue                                              
                                                                   
We primarily generate Advertising Revenue from fees paid by
advertisers who use our Advertising solutions to grow and monetize
their content. We are able to grow our Advertising Revenue by
improving our various technologies.

Advertising clients include a wide variety of advertisers, from
indie developer studios to some of the largest global internet
platforms, such as Facebook and Google. We see multiple
opportunities to gain new Advertising clients, and to increase
spend from existing clients, as we help them grow their businesses
and make them more successful.

Our Advertising solutions include AppDiscovery, MAX, Adjust, and
Wurl. Clients use AppDiscovery to automate, optimize, and manage
their user acquisition investments. They set marketing and user
growth goals, and AppDiscovery optimizes their ad spend in an
effort to achieve their return on advertising spend targets and
other marketing objectives. AppDiscovery comprises the vast
majority of Advertising Revenue. Revenue is generated from our
advertisers, typically on a performance basis, and shared with our
advertising publishers, typically on a cost per impression model.

Advertising clients use MAX to optimize purchases of app
advertising inventory. The MAX tool provides insights to manage
against key performance indicators, understand the long-term value
of users, and help manage profitability. Revenue from MAX is
generated based on a percentage of client spend. As more
advertising networks move to in-app real-time bidding, we expect
growth in the adoption of, and revenue from, MAX.

Advertising clients use Adjust's measurement and analytics
marketing platform to better understand their users' journey while
allowing marketers to make smarter decisions through measurement,
attribution and fraud prevention. Revenue from Adjust is primarily
generated from an annual software subscription fee.

Advertising clients use Wurl's connected TV ("CTV") platform to
distribute streaming video, maximize Advertising Revenue, and
acquire and retain viewers or subscribers. Revenue from Wurl is
primarily generated from content companies, typically on a usage-
based model.
                                                                   
  Apps Revenue                                                     
                                                                   
Apps Revenue is generated when a user of one of our Apps makes an
in-app purchase ("IAP") and when clients purchase the digital
advertising inventory of our portfolio of Apps ("IAA"). We are able
to grow our Apps Revenue by adding more apps to our Apps portfolio
and increasing engagement on our existing Apps.

Our Apps are generally free-to-play mobile games and generate IAP
Revenue through IAPs. IAPs consist of virtual goods used to enhance
gameplay, accelerate access to certain features or levels, and
augment other mobile game progression opportunities for the user.
IAPs drive more engagement and better economics from our Apps. The
vast majority of our IAP Revenue flows through two app stores,
Apple App Store and Google Play, which charge us a standard
commission on IAPs. IAP Revenue represented 70% of total Apps
Revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2025.

During the three months ended March 31, 2025, we had an average of
1.5 million Monthly Active Payers ("MAPs") across our portfolio of
Apps. Over that period, we had an Average Revenue Per Monthly
Active Payer ("ARPMAP") of $52. See “Key Metrics” below for
additional information on how we calculate MAPs and ARPMAP.

IAA clients that purchase advertising inventory from our Apps are
able to target highly relevant users from our diverse and global
portfolio of over 200 mobile games. Our clients leverage a broad
set of high-performing mobile ad formats, including playable and
rewarded video, and are able to match these ads with relevant users
resulting in a better return on their advertising spend. By
increasing the number of users and their engagement, as well as
better matching ads with the appropriate target audience, we are
able to increase our revenue from IAA clients that purchase
advertising inventory from our Apps. IAA Revenue represented 30% of
total Apps Revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2025.

On May 7, 2025, we, along with our subsidiaries Morocco, Inc. and
AppLovin GmbH (collectively, the “Sellers”) entered into a Purchase
Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Tripledot (“Purchaser Parent”) and
its subsidiaries Eton Games Inc. and Tripledot Group Holdings
Limited (collectively, with Purchaser Parent, the “Purchasers”). On
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Agreement,
Sellers will transfer the equity interests of certain wholly-owned
subsidiaries that are engaged in our mobile gaming business (the
“Gaming Business”) to Purchasers, for total consideration (the
“Purchase Price,” and such sale, together with the other
transactions contemplated by the Agreement, the “Transactions”)
consisting of (i) $400.0 million in cash consideration, comprised
of (a) $150.0 million to be paid in cash at the closing of the
Transactions (the “Closing”) and (b) a $250.0 million secured
promissory note to be issued by Eton Games Inc. (collectively with
any other U.S. subsidiaries of Purchaser Parent designated as a co-
Borrower thereunder, “Borrowers”) to us or our designated affiliate
at the Closing (the “Promissory Note”), and (ii) equity
consideration comprised of ordinary shares of Purchaser Parent
representing approximately 20% of the fully-diluted equity
capitalization of Purchaser Parent at the Closing. Purchaser Parent
anticipates financing a portion of the cash Purchase Price payable
at the Closing with debt.

The terms of the Promissory Note provide for a maturity of 18
months from the Closing, with no amortization. The Borrowers are
permitted to voluntarily prepay the outstanding principal amount of
the Promissory Note, in
                                20

whole or in part, without premium or penalty. The advance under the
Promissory Note bears interest at a rate per annum equal to eleven
percent (11%). As of the Closing, the obligations of the Borrowers
under the Promissory Note will be guaranteed by all U.S. and U.K.
subsidiaries of the Purchaser Parent, subject to certain
exceptions, and secured by (i) substantially all assets of the
Borrowers and the U.S. guarantors and (ii) a pledge by Tripledot
Group Holdings Limited of the equity interests held by it in each
Borrower and U.S. guarantor, in each case subject to permitted
liens and certain customary exceptions. Within 90 days after the
Closing, the obligations of the Borrowers under the Promissory Note
will also be guaranteed by Purchaser Parent and secured by (a)
substantially all assets of the U.K. guarantors and (b) a share
pledge by Purchaser Parent of the equity interests held by it in
each U.K. guarantor and U.S. guarantor, in each case subject to
permitted liens and certain customary exceptions. The Promissory
Note includes negative covenants limiting, with certain exceptions,
(1) dispositions, (2) changes in business, (3) mergers or
acquisitions, (4) indebtedness, (5) liens, (6) distributions and
investments and (7) transactions with affiliates; provided that the
foregoing covenants allow redemptions and repurchases of a certain
series of stock of Purchaser Parent up to an aggregate amount of
$205 million. The Promissory Note also contains certain customary
affirmative covenants and events of default.

The consummation of the Transactions is subject to the satisfaction
or waiver of certain customary closing conditions, including (i)
the approval of the Agreement and the Transactions by the requisite
shareholders of Purchaser Parent and the occurrence of certain pre-
Closing actions with respect to Purchaser Parent’s capitalization
structure, (ii) the absence of any law or order preventing or
prohibiting the consummation of the Transactions, (iii) expiration
of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, (iv) the accuracy of each
party’s representations and warranties (subject to customary
materiality and other qualifiers), (v) each party’s performance and
compliance with its covenants contained in the Agreement, (vi) the
absence of a material adverse effect on the Gaming Business or on
Purchaser Parent, and (vii) other closing deliverables. The
Transactions are not subject to any financing condition.
                                                                   
  Key Metrics                                                      
                                                                   
We review the following key metrics on a regular basis in order to
evaluate the health of our Apps segment, identify trends affecting
its performance, prepare financial projections, and make strategic
decisions.
Monthly Active Payers ("MAPs"). We define a MAP as a unique mobile
device active on one of our Apps in a month that completed at least
one IAP during that time period. A consumer who makes IAPs within
two separate Apps on the same mobile device in a monthly period
will be counted as two MAPs. MAPs for a particular time period
longer than one month are the average MAPs for each month during
that period. We estimate the number of MAPs by aggregating certain
data from third-party attribution partners.

Average Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer ("ARPMAP"). We define
ARPMAP as (i) the total IAP Revenue derived from our Apps in a
monthly period, divided by (ii) MAPs in that same period. ARPMAP
for a particular time period longer than one month is the average
ARPMAP for each month during that period. ARPMAP shows how
efficiently we are monetizing each MAP.

The following table shows our Monthly Active Payers and Average
Revenue Per Monthly Active Payer for the three months ended March
31, 2025 and 2024:

Our key metrics are not based on any standardized industry
methodology and are not necessarily calculated in the same manner
or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other
companies. Similarly, our key metrics may differ from estimates
published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our
competitors due to differences in methodology. The numbers that we
use to calculate MAPs and ARPMAP are based on internal data. While
these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable
judgments and estimates for the applicable period of measurement,
there are inherent challenges in measuring usage and engagement. We
regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our
internal metrics to improve their accuracy.

  Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin                       
                                                                   
We define Adjusted EBITDA for a particular period as net income
before interest expense, other income, net (excluding certain
recurring items), provision for income taxes, amortization,
depreciation and write-offs and as
                                21                                 
Table of C ontents
further adjusted for stock-based compensation expense, transaction-
related expense, restructuring costs, loss on disposal of long-
lived assets, goodwill impairment, and non-operating foreign
exchange (gain) losses. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as
Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the same period.

Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are key measures we use
to assess our financial performance and are also used for internal
planning and forecasting purposes. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and
Adjusted EBITDA margin are helpful to investors, analysts, and
other interested parties because they can assist in providing a
more consistent and comparable overview of our operations across
our historical financial periods. In addition, these measures are
frequently used by analysts, investors, and other interested
parties to evaluate and assess performance. We use Adjusted EBITDA
and Adjusted EBITDA margin in conjunction with GAAP measures as
part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the
preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts,
to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to
communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial
performance.

Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are non-GAAP financial
measures and are presented for supplemental informational purposes
only and should not be considered as alternatives or substitutes to
financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. These
measures have certain limitations in that they do not include the
impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated
statement of operations that are necessary to run our business. Our
definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies
and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other
companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Thus, our
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin should be considered in
addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures
prepared in accordance with GAAP.

EBITDA margin for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024,

We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating
activities less purchases of property and equipment and principal
payment of finance leases. We use Free Cash Flow to help manage the
health of our business, prepare budgets and for capital allocation
purposes. We believe Free Cash Flow provides useful supplemental
information to help investors understand underlying trends in our
business and our liquidity. Free cash flow has certain limitations,
including that it does not reflect our future contractual
commitments. Our definition may differ from the definitions used by
other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In
addition, other companies may not publish Free Cash Flow or similar
metrics. Thus, our Free Cash Flow should be considered in addition
to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, measures
prepared in accordance with GAAP.

We believe that the future success of our business depends on many
factors, including the factors described below. While each of these
factors presents significant opportunities for our business, they
also pose important challenges that we must successfully address in
order to continue to grow profitably while maintaining strong cash
flow.
                                                                   
  Continue to invest in innovation                                 
                                                                   
We have made, and intend to continue to make, significant
investments in our Advertising solutions to enhance their
effectiveness and value proposition for our clients. We expect that
these investments will require spending on research and
development, and acquisitions and partnerships related to
technology components and products. We believe investments in our
technology, including our AI-powered advertising recommendation
engine AXON, AppDiscovery, Adjust, and MAX, will further improve
effectiveness for advertisers. In addition, we plan to continue to
invest in the AI-based, self-learning capabilities of our
advertising recommendation engine, AXON. Our investments will also
allow us to enter into and expand into new verticals outside of
gaming, such as e-commerce, CTV, original equipment manufacturer
("OEM"), and carrier-related markets. While our investments in
research and development and acquisitions and partnerships may not
result in revenue in the near term, we believe these investments
position us to increase our revenue over time.
                                                                   
  Retain and grow existing clients                                 
                                                                   
We rely on existing clients for a significant portion of our
revenue. As we improve our Advertising solutions and Apps, we can
attract additional spend from these clients. Our clients include
indie studio developers and some of the largest advertising
platforms in the world. We believe there is significant room for us
to further expand our relationships with these clients and increase
their usage of our Advertising solutions.
In the past, our clients have generally increased their usage of
our Advertising solutions and Apps, and as a result, growth from
existing clients has been a primary driver of our revenue growth.
We must continue to retain our existing clients and expand their
spend with us over time to continue to grow our revenue, increase
profitability and drive greater cash flow.
                                                                   
  Add new clients globally                                         
                                                                   
Our future success depends in part on our ability to acquire new
clients. During the three months ended March 31, 2025, 45% of our
revenue was generated from outside of the United States. We believe
that the global opportunity is significant and will continue to
expand as developers and advertisers outside the United States
adopt our Advertising solutions and advertise on our Apps. We also
see opportunities to acquire new clients outside of mobile gaming,
as the capabilities of our Advertising solutions are relevant to
the broader advertising ecosystem, including in areas such as
e-commerce. We are investing in direct sales, product development,
education, and other capabilities to drive increased awareness and
adoption of our Advertising solutions and Apps, which investments
may impact our profitability in the near term as we seek further
scale.
                                                                   
  Continued execution of strategic partnerships                    
                                                                   
We continue to explore strategic partnership opportunities related
to our Advertising solutions and the expansion of the markets it
serves and we may from time to time evaluate strategic acquisitions
and partnerships opportunistically. From the beginning of 2018
through March 31, 2025, we have invested approximately $4.1 billion
in 33 strategic acquisitions and partnerships with mobile app
developers and for technologies or relationships to
                                23

enhance our Advertising solutions, including the acquisition of MAX
in 2018, Adjust in April 2021, MoPub in January 2022, and Wurl in
April 2022. We believe our future results of operations will be
affected by our ability to continue to identify and execute such
strategic transactions that are accretive to our growth and
profitability. In April 2025, we provided an indication of interest
to the President of the United States to explore a purchase of
TikTok in all markets outside of China. This indication of interest
is preliminary and there can be no assurance that a transaction
involving us will proceed.
Growth and structure of the mobile app and advertising ecosystems
Our business and results of operations will be impacted by industry
factors that drive the overall performance of the mobile app and
advertising ecosystems. Mobile app developers, including AppLovin,
rely on third-party platforms, such as the Apple App Store and
Google Play Store, among others, to distribute games, collect
payments made for IAPs, and target users with relevant advertising.
We expect this to continue for the foreseeable future. These third-
party platforms have significant market power and discretion to set
platform fees, select which apps to promote, and decide how much
consumer information to provide to advertising networks that enable
our Advertising solutions to target users with personalized and
relevant advertising and allocate marketing campaigns in an
efficient and cost-effective manner. Any changes made in the
policies of third-party platforms could drive rapid change across
the mobile app and advertising ecosystems. For example, in April
2021, Apple started implementing its application tracking
transparency framework that, among other things, requires users'
opt-in consent for certain types of tracking. While this
transparency framework has not had a significant impact on our
overall business, it may do so in the future, including with
respect to the effectiveness of our advertising practices and/or
our ability to efficiently generate revenue for our Apps. We rely
in part on Identifier for Advertisers ("IDFA") to provide us with
data that helps our Advertising solutions better market and
monetize Apps. In light of the IDFA and transparency changes, we
made changes to our data collection practices. To the extent we are
unable to utilize IDFA or a similar offering, or if the
transparency changes and any related opt-in or other requirements
result in decreases in the availability or utility of data relating
to Apps, our Advertising solutions may not be as effective, we may
not be able to continue to efficiently generate revenue for our
Apps, and our revenue and results of operations may be harmed.
Additionally, Apple implemented new requirements for consumer
disclosures regarding privacy and data processing practices in
December 2020, which has resulted in increased compliance
requirements and could result in decreased usage of our Apps. Apple
incorporated new SDK privacy controls into iOS 17, which was
released in September 2023, including privacy manifests and
signatures designed to allow app developers to outline the data
practices for SDKs embedded in their apps, manage tracking domains
within SDKs, and curb device fingerprinting by requiring app
developers to select allowed reasons for using data received
through certain APIs. In February 2022, Google announced its
Privacy Sandbox initiative for Android, a multi-year effort
expected to restrict tracking activity and limit advertisers'
ability to collect app and user data across Android devices. In
January 2024, Google commenced rolling out a Chrome feature, called
Tracking Protection, which limits cross-site tracking. In May 2023,
Google announced new consent management platform ("CMP")
requirements for ads served in the European Economic Area ("EEA")
and UK, which requires, as of January 2024, publishers using Google
AdSense, Ad Manager, or AdMob to use a CMP that has been certified
by Google and has integrated with the Interactive Advertising
Bureau’s (“IAB”) Transparency and Consent Framework when serving
ads to users in the EEA or the UK. While to date these third-party
platform privacy changes have had some impact on the
discoverability of apps across these platforms and have had a
relatively muted aggregate impact on our results of operations, the
ultimate impact of these or any similar or future changes to the
policies of Apple or Google could adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.

New tools for developers, industry standards, and platforms may
emerge in the future. We believe our focus on the advertising
ecosystem has allowed us to understand the needs of our clients and
our relentless innovation has enabled us to quickly adapt to
changes in the industry and pioneer new solutions. We must continue
to innovate and stay ahead of developments in the advertising and
mobile app ecosystems in order for our business to succeed and our
results of operations to continue to improve.

We generate Advertising Revenue primarily from fees collected from
advertisers spending on AppDiscovery, typically on a performance
basis, then shared with our advertising publishers, typically on a
cost per impression basis. Advertising Revenue also includes fees
generated based on a percentage of client spend through MAX and
subscription fees for Adjust's measurement and analytics marketing
platform. Revenue from other services under Advertising was not
material.

We generate Apps Revenue from IAPs made by the users within our
Apps and from IAA generated from

of revenue to increase in absolute dollars over the long term as
our business and revenue continue to grow. We also expect our cost
of revenue as a percentage of revenue to fluctuate period-over-
period .

Sales and marketing . Sales and marketing expenses consist
primarily of user acquisition costs, marketing programs and other
advertising expenses, professional services costs related to the
marketing of apps by third parties, personnel-related expenses
including salaries, employee benefits, and stock-based compensation
for employees engaged in sales and marketing activities,
amortization of acquired user-related intangible assets, travel and
allocated facilities and information technology costs.

We plan to continue to invest in sales and marketing to grow our
Advertising customer base and increase brand awareness. We expect
sales and marketing expenses to fluctuate period-over-period as we
launch new games. We also expect our sales and marketing expenses
as a percentage of revenue to fluctuate period-over-period in the
near term as we invest to grow our customer base and increase brand
awareness, and to decrease over the long term as we benefit from
greater scale.

Research and development. Research and development expenses consist
primarily of product development costs, including personnel-related
expenses such as salaries, employee benefits, and stock-based
compensation for employees engaged in research and development
activities, professional services costs related to development of
new apps by third parties, consulting costs, regulatory compliance
costs, and allocated facilities and information technology costs.

We plan to continue to invest in research and development to
continue to enhance our Advertising solutions and to improve
existing games and develop new games. We expect our research and
development expenses as a percentage of revenue to fluctuate
period-over-period in the near term as we invest to enhance our
Advertising solutions and improve our existing Apps and develop new
Apps, and to decrease over the long term as we benefit from greater
scale.

General and administrative . General and administrative expenses
consist primarily of costs incurred to support our business,
including personnel-related expenses such as salaries, employee
benefits, and stock-based compensation for employees engaged in
finance, accounting, legal, human resources and administration,
professional services fees for legal, accounting, recruiting, and
administrative services (including acquisition or other
transaction-related expenses), insurance, travel, and allocated
facilities and information technology costs.

We plan to continue to invest in our general and administrative
function to support the growth of our business. We expect our
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue to
fluctuate period-over-period in the near term as we invest to
support the growth of our business, and to decrease over the long
term as we benefit from greater scale.

Goodwill impairment. Goodwill impairment expenses consist of a non-
cash impairment loss recognized for the goodwill of the Apps
reporting unit in the three months ended March 31, 2025, as a
result of the impairment analysis we performed during the first
quarter of 2025.

Interest expense. Interest expense consists primarily of interest
expense associated with our outstanding debt, including accretion
of debt discount, and issuance costs.

Other income, net. Other income, net, primarily includes interest
earned on our cash and cash equivalents, fair value adjustments
relating to our non-marketable equity securities, and foreign
currency gains and losses.

Provision for income taxes. We are subject to income taxes in the
United States and foreign jurisdictions in which we do business.
These foreign jurisdictions have different statutory tax rates than
those in the United States. Additionally, certain of our foreign
earnings may also be taxable in the United States. Accordingly, our
effective tax rate will vary depending on the relative proportion
of foreign to domestic income, impacts from acquisition
restructuring, deduction benefits related to foreign-derived
intangible income, future changes in the valuation of our deferred
tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws. Additionally,
our effective tax rate can vary based on the amount of pre-tax
income or loss.

Three Months Ended March 31, 2025 Compared to Three Months Ended
March 31, 2024

For the three months ended March 31, 2025, our Advertising Revenue
increased by $480.6 million, or 71%, compared to the same period in
the prior year due primarily to improved AppDiscovery performance,
where net revenue per installation increased 49% and the volume of
installations increased 22%. We do not recognize Advertising
Revenue from transactions with our studios.

For the three months ended March 31, 2025, our Apps Revenue
decreased by $54.7 million, or 14%, from the prior year period. For
the three months ended March 31, 2025, our IAP Revenue from Apps
decreased by $31.7 million, or 12%, due primarily to a 15% decrease
in the volume of in-app purchases, partially offset by a 3%
increase in price per in-app purchase, and our IAA Revenue from
Apps decreased by $23.0 million, or 19%, due primarily to a 43%
decrease in the volume of advertising impressions, partially offset
by a 43% increase in price per advertising impression.

Cost of revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2025 decreased
by $22.9 million, or 8%, compared to the same period in the prior
year, due primarily to a decrease of $35.7 million in amortization
of intangible assets resulting from the end of the useful life of
certain intangible assets and a decrease of $13.2 million in third-
party payment processing fees as a result of the decline in IAP
revenue, partially offset by an increase of $27.6 million in
expenses associated with operating our network infrastructure
driven by the growth in our Advertising operations.

foreign currency losses of $0.4 million.

In the three months ended March 31, 2025, the provision for income
taxes increased by $10.2 million, or 32% , as compared to the same
period in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by
higher pre-tax income from business operations during the three
months ended March 31, 2025 and global minimum tax, partially
offset by higher stock-based compensation benefit and foreign
income taxed at different rates.

Three Months Ended March 31, 2025 Compared to Three Months Ended
March 31, 2024

The $451.2 million, or 92%, increase in Advertising Adjusted EBITDA
for the three months ended March 31, 2025 was primarily driven by
an increase in Advertising Revenue of $480.6 million and a decrease
of $4.5 million in personnel-related expenses, partially offset by
an increase of $28.2 million in expenses associated with operating
our network infrastructure driven by the growth in our operations.

The $5.0 million, or 9%, increase in Apps Adjusted EBITDA for the
three months ended March 31, 2025 was primarily driven by a
decrease of $39.2 million in user acquisition costs, a decrease of
$13.2 million in third-party payment processing fees as a result of
the decline in IAP revenue, and a decrease of $9.5 million in
personnel-related expenses, partially offset by a decrease in Apps
Revenue of $54.7 million.

As of March 31, 2025, we had cash and cash equivalents of $551.0
million, consisting primarily of cash on deposit with banks and
short-term liquid investments in money market deposit accounts. We
believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flows
expected to be generated by our operations, and, if necessary, our
borrowing capacity under the 2024 Credit Agreement, which provided
$793.7 million of remaining availability as of March 31, 2025,
would be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated working capital and
capital expenditures needs for at least the next 12 months. Our
future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including
our revenue growth rate; sales and marketing activities; timing and
extent of spending to support our research and development efforts;
capital expenditures to purchase hardware and software; our
continued need to invest in our IT infrastructure to support our
growth; and the volume and timing of our stock repurchases. In
addition, we may enter into additional strategic partnerships as
well as agreements to acquire or invest in teams and technologies,
including intellectual property rights, which could increase our
cash requirements. As a result of these and other factors, we may
be required to seek additional equity or debt financing sooner than
we currently anticipate. See the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks
Related to Financial and Accounting Matters” for more information
regarding risks related to liquidity and capital resources.

During the three months ended March 31, 2025, we repurchased
2,931,609 shares of Class A common stock for an aggregate amount,
including commissions and fees, of $1.0 billion. As of March 31,
2025, $1.3 billion remained available for repurchases under the
program. In February 2025, our Board modified our stock repurchase
program such that $500 million was immediately available for
repurchase of shares of our Class A common stock, notwithstanding
the amount that otherwise would have remained available during the
quarter under the prior program limitation, and such limit shall be
increased in future quarters by the amount of free cash flow
generated in the preceding fiscal quarter, with such increases to
be carried forward and remain available for future repurchases if
not used (up to the total authorized amount available for
repurchases). Repurchases may be made from time to time through
open market purchases or through privately negotiated transactions,
subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements and
other relevant factors. For additional information, see Note 6 –

Except for scheduled payments from the ongoing business, there were
no other material changes to our commitments under contractual
obligations since December 31, 2024. For additional information,

  Critical Accounting Estimates                                    
                                                                   
Our condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in
accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our condensed consolidated
financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue,
expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate
our estimates based on assumptions that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates are inherently
subject to judgment and actual results could differ materially from
those estimates.

An accounting estimate is considered critical if it involves
significant subjectivity and judgment, and if changes in the
estimate have had or are reasonably likely to have a material
effect on our consolidated financial statements.

There have been no material changes to our critical accounting
estimates during the three months ended March 31, 2025, as compared
to those disclosed in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations set forth in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,

   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures                
                                                                   
Our management, with the participation of our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act), as of the
end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer have concluded that, as of such date,
our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a
reasonable assurance level as of March 31, 2025.

There were no changes in our internal control over financial
reporting identified in management’s evaluation pursuant to Rules
13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the quarter ended
March 31, 2025 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.

Our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of
achieving their desired objectives. Management does not expect,
however, that our disclosure controls and procedures or our
internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect
all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well
designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions, and can
provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its
objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can
provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud
will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud,
if any, within our company have been detected.

We are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in,
legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of
business, as well as governmental and other regulatory
investigations and proceedings. In addition, third parties have in
the past, and may in the future, assert claims against us in the
form of letters and other communications.

Securities Litigation

Beginning in early March 2025, certain alleged stockholders filed
putative class action complaints against the company, Adam
Foroughi, Matthew Stumpf, and/or Herald Chen asserting claims for
alleged violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and Rule
10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and seeking unspecified monetary
relief, interest, and attorneys’ fees. On March 5, 2025, Michael
Quiero filed the first complaint against the company, Adam
Foroughi, and Matt Stumpf in the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of California (the “Northern District of
California”); on March 24, 2025, Ben Brownback filed the second
complaint in the same court against the company, Adam Foroughi,
Matthew Stumpf, and Herald Chen in the Northern District of
California; and on April 17, 2025, the Wayne County Employees’
Retirement System filed the third complaint in the same court
against the company, Adam Foroughi, Matthew Stumpf, and Herald Chen
in the Northern District of California (collectively, the
“Securities Complaints”). The Securities Complaints allege that the
defendants made materially false and misleading statements
regarding our Advertising solutions and financial growth. The
Securities Complaints allege a putative class period running from
May 10, 2023 through March 26, 2025. We believe that the
allegations in the Securities Complaints lack merit and will
vigorously contest these actions.

Shareholder Derivative Litigation

On March 25, 2025, Amit Patel, an alleged shareholder, filed a
shareholder derivative complaint in the Northern District of
California against the individual then current members of the
company’s board of directors, Adam Foroughi, and Matthew Stumpf
(collectively, the “D&O Parties”) alleging claims for violations of
Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, breaches of their fiduciary
duties, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement,
and waste of corporate assets (collectively, the “Shareholder
Derivative Complaint”). The Shareholder Derivative Complaint also
asserts claims for contribution under the Exchange Act against Adam
Foroughi and Matthew Stumpf and seeks unspecified monetary relief,
certain injunctive relief, restitution, and attorneys’ fees from
the D&O Parties. Relying on the Securities Complaints, the
Shareholder Derivative Complaint alleges that the D&O Parties made
materially false and misleading statements regarding our
Advertising solutions and financial growth. We believe that the
allegations in the Shareholder Derivative Complaint lack merit and
will vigorously contest these actions.

While we remain confident in the company’s defenses to the asserted
allegations in these cases, it is not possible to determine the
ultimate outcome at this time, and thus we cannot reasonably
estimate the maximum potential exposure or range of possible loss.

Future litigation may be necessary to defend ourselves and our
business partners and to determine the scope, enforceability, and
validity of third-party proprietary rights, or to establish our
proprietary rights. The results of any current or future litigation
cannot be predicted with certainty, and regardless of the outcome,
litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and
settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other
factors.

You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described
below, together with all of the other information in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q, including the section titled “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations” and our unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements and the related notes, before making a decision to
invest in our Class A common stock. Our business, financial
condition, results of operations, or prospects could also be
adversely affected by risks and uncertainties that are not
presently known to us or that we currently believe are not
material. If any of the risks actually occur, our business,
financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be
adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our Class A
common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your
investment.

Investing in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of
risk because our business is subject to numerous risks and
uncertainties, as further described below. The principal factors
and uncertainties that make investing in our Class A common stock
subject to risk include, among other things:

changes with respect to IAPs, and manage the economies in our
AppLovin Apps;

• our ability to achieve or maintain profitability with increasing
operating expenses;

• risks related to not having long-term agreements with our
clients;

• AppLovin apps not meeting user expectations;

• our ability to maintain our brand awareness;

• our reliance on third parties complying with their obligations;
Legal and Regulatory Matters
• changes in laws and regulations concerning privacy, information
security, data protection, consumer protection, AI, advertising,
tracking, targeting, and protection of minors;

• changes in U.S. and foreign laws, many of which are unsettled and
still developing;

• the development and use of AI in our offerings and business;
                                35

structure;

intellectual property rights or the costs involved in such
enforcement;

property;
Financial and Accounting Matters
• our ability to maintain an effective system of disclosure
controls and internal control over financial reporting;

our key metrics;

charge to earnings if our goodwill becomes impaired;

• our substantial indebtedness and obligations thereunder;

significant debt service obligations;

• the availability of additional capital on acceptable terms;
Ownership of our Class A common stock and Governance
• the multi-class structure of our common stock and the Voting
Agreement among the Voting Agreement Parties;

• our status as a “controlled company” within the meaning of the
Nasdaq corporate governance requirements;

• volatility of the market price of our Class A common stock;

• the possibility that we may not realize the anticipated long-term
stockholder value of our share repurchase programs;

• the issuance of additional stock in connection with financings,
acquisitions, investments, our equity incentive plans, or
otherwise;

• provisions of Delaware law, the Voting Agreement, our amended and
restated certificate of incorporation, and our amended and restated
bylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest
difficult; and

• exclusive forum provisions in our amended and restated bylaws.
                                                                   
   Risks Related to Our Business, Operations and Industry          
                                                                   
Our results of operations are likely to fluctuate from period-to-
period, which could cause the market price of our Class A common
stock to decline.

Our results of operations have fluctuated in the past and are
likely to fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-
to-year in the future for a variety of reasons, many of which are
outside of our control and difficult to predict. As a result, you
should not rely upon our historical results of operations as
indicators of future performance. Numerous factors can influence
our results of operations, including:

• our ability to maintain and grow our client and user bases;
                                36

• changes to our Advertising solutions, Apps, or other offerings;

• the timing and efficacy of improvements to our algorithms, models
and AI-powered advertising recommendation engine AXON generally;

• the development and introduction of new solutions, entry into new
markets, or the development of new mobile apps by our studios or
our competitors;

• changes to the policies or practices of companies or governmental
agencies that determine access to third-party platforms, such as
the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store, or to our
Advertising solutions, Apps, website, or the internet generally;

• changes to the policies or practices of third-party platforms,
such as the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store, including
with respect to Apple’s Identifier for Advertisers ("IDFA"), which
helps advertisers assess the effectiveness of their advertising
efforts, and with respect to transparency regarding data
processing;

• the diversification and growth of revenue sources beyond our
current Advertising solutions and Apps;

• our ability to achieve the anticipated synergies from our
strategic acquisitions and effectively integrate new assets and
businesses acquired by us;

• our ability to close the pending sale of our Apps portfolio;

• the actions of our competitors, both with respect to their own
offerings and, to the extent such competitors are also our clients,
with respect to their use of our Advertising solutions;

• costs and expenses related to the strategic acquisitions and
partnerships, including costs related to integrating mobile gaming
studios or other companies that we acquire, as well as costs and
expenses related to the development of our Advertising solutions or
Apps;

• our ability to achieve or maintain profitability;

• increases in and timing of operating expenses that we may incur
to grow and expand our operations and to remain competitive;

• system failures or outages, or actual or perceived breaches of
security or privacy, and the costs associated with preventing,
responding to, or remediating any such outages or breaches;

• changes in the legislative or regulatory environment, including
with respect to privacy, data protection, or AI or actions by
governments or regulators, including fines, orders, or consent
decrees;

• charges associated with impairment of any assets on our balance
sheet or changes in our expected estimated useful life of property
and equipment and intangible assets;

• adverse litigation judgments, settlements, or other litigation-
related costs and the fees associated with investigating and
defending claims;

• the overall tax rate for our business, which may be affected by
the mix of income we earn in the United States and in jurisdictions
with comparatively lower tax rates;

• the impact of changes in tax laws or judicial or regulatory
interpretations of tax laws, which are recorded in the period such
laws are enacted or interpretations are issued and may
significantly affect the effective tax rate of that period;

• the impact of tariffs recently imposed by the U.S. government and
its trading partners in response, other possible tariffs or trade
protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, new
or different customs duties, trade embargoes and sanctions and
other trade barriers;

• the application of new or changing financial accounting standards
or practices; and

• changes in regional or global business or macroeconomic
conditions, including as a result of uncertainty in the global
banking and financial services markets, political uncertainty and
international conflicts around the world, inflation, and high
interest rates, which may impact the other factors described above.

In particular, it is difficult to predict if, when, or how newly-
launched products, software or new markets may begin to generate
revenue or decline in popularity. Further, we cannot be certain if
a new App or product will become popular amongst users and generate
revenue. The success of our business depends in part on our ability
                                37

to develop and enhance our Advertising solutions, including
expansion into new markets, and consistently and timely launch new
Apps and products. It is difficult for us to predict with certainty
when we will expand our Advertising solutions, launch a new App or
product, or enter a new market as we may require longer development
schedules or soft launch periods to meet our quality standards and
expectations. If our clients do not adopt our new Advertising
offerings, or develop or further invest in their own competing
alternatives, or if we are unable to successfully launch or acquire
new Apps or products or maintain or improve existing Apps or
successfully enter a new market, our business and results of
operations could be adversely affected. Fluctuations in our results
of operations may cause such results to fall below our financial
guidance or the expectations of analysts or investors, which could
cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.

Security breaches, improper access to or disclosure of our data or
user data, other hacking and phishing attacks on our systems, or
other cyber incidents could harm our reputation and adversely
affect our business.

The advertising and mobile app ecosystems are prone to cyberattacks
by third parties seeking unauthorized access to our data or the
data of our clients or users or to disrupt our ability to provide
service. Our Advertising solutions, Apps, and other offerings
involve the collection, storage, transmission, and other processing
of a large amount of data, including personal information, and we
and our third-party service providers otherwise store and process
information, including our confidential and proprietary business
information, and personal information and other information
relating to our employees, users, and clients or other third
parties. We also store and implement measures designed to secure
the source code for our Advertising solutions and Apps as they are
created. Any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches or
incidents impacting our Advertising solutions, Apps, or our systems
or other systems used in our business, or improper access to or
disclosure of our data, including source code, or user data,
including personal information or content from users, or
information from clients or other third parties, that is stored or
otherwise processed in our business could result in the
unauthorized loss, modification, disclosure, destruction, or other
unauthorized processing of such data, or unavailability of data or
of our Advertising solutions, Apps, or other offerings. Any such
event, or the perception it has occurred, could adversely affect
our business and reputation, damage our operations, result in
claims, litigation, or regulatory investigations or enforcement
actions, fines, penalties, or other liability or obligations, and
diminish our competitive position. In particular, a breach or
incident, whether physical, electronic, or otherwise, impacting
systems on which source code or other sensitive data are stored
could lead to loss, disruption, unavailability, or piracy of, or
damage to, our offerings, lost or reduced ability to protect our
intellectual property, and diminished competitive position.

Malware (including ransomware), viruses, social engineering
(predominantly spear phishing attacks or smishing), and general
hacking have become more prevalent in the advertising and mobile
app ecosystems. Some of these have occurred on our systems and
otherwise in our business in the past, and we expect they will
continue to occur in the future. We regularly encounter attempts to
create false or undesirable user accounts or take other actions for
purposes such as spamming or other objectionable ends. Any actual
or attempted breaches, incidents, or attacks may cause disruptions
or interruptions to our Advertising solutions, Apps, or other
offerings, degrade the user experience, impair, disrupt, or
interrupt our systems and networks and other systems and networks
used in our business, or adversely affect our reputation, business,
financial condition, and results of operations. Our efforts to
protect our Advertising solutions, Apps, and other offerings, our
systems and other systems used in our business, and our data, user
data, and information from clients, partners, and other third
parties, and to disable or otherwise respond to undesirable
activities on our offerings, may also be unsuccessful due to
software bugs or other technical defects, errors, or malfunctions;
employee, contractor, vendor, or partner error or malfeasance,
including defects or vulnerabilities in information technology
systems or offerings; cyberattacks, attacks designed to disrupt
systems or facilities; breaches of physical security of our
facilities or technical infrastructure; or other threats that
evolve. Additionally, any such breach, incident, attack,
malfunction, defect, or vulnerability, or the perception that any
of these has occurred, may cause clients or users to lose
confidence and trust in our Advertising solutions, Apps, or other
offerings and otherwise harm our reputation and market position.

In addition, some developers or other business partners, such as
those that help us measure the effectiveness of advertisements, may
receive or store information provided by us or by our clients or
users through mobile or web apps or other means. These third
parties or others may misappropriate or misuse this information. If
these third parties fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data
security practices, or experience a breach of, or other security
incident impacting, their networks or systems, our data or our
users’ data may be lost, destroyed, or accessed, modified,
disclosed, or otherwise processed in unauthorized manners. In such
an event, or if such an event is perceived to have occurred, we may
suffer damage to our reputation, may have increased costs arising
from the restoration or implementation of additional security
measures and other costs relating to the incident, and we may face
claims, demands, investigations, and other proceedings by private
parties or governmental actors, and
                                38                                 
Table of C ontents
fines, penalties, and other liability or obligations, any of which
could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and
results of operations. Any theft or unauthorized use or publication
of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as
a result of such an event could also adversely affect our business,
competitive position, and results of operations.

Cyberattacks continue to evolve in sophistication and volume, and
may be difficult to detect for long periods. Although we have
developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our
data, user data, and information from our partners; to prevent data
loss, disable undesirable accounts and activities on our
Advertising solutions, Apps, or other offerings; and to prevent and
detect security breaches, we cannot assure you that such measures
will provide comprehensive security, that we have been or will be
able to identify breaches or other incidents or to react to them in
a timely manner or that our remediation efforts will be successful.
We experience cyberattacks and other security incidents of varying
degrees from time to time, and we may incur significant costs in
investigating, protecting against, litigating, or remediating such
incidents. We may face increased risks of cyberattacks and other
security incidents as a result of increases in remote work. Our use
of third-party systems for remote workforce operations introduces
security risks and increased cyberattacks, such as phishing attacks
by threat actors as a method for targeting personnel. Further, in
connection with geopolitical events and conflicts, such as those in
Ukraine and the Middle East, there may be a heightened risk of
potential cyberattacks by state actors or others.

Additionally, our Advertising solutions, Apps, and other offerings
operate in conjunction with, and we are in some cases dependent
upon, third-party products, services, and components. Our ability
to monitor our third-party service providers’ data security is
limited, and in any event, attackers may be able to circumvent our
third-party service providers’ data security measures. There have
been and may continue to be significant attacks on certain third-
party providers, and we cannot guarantee that our or our third-
party providers’ systems and networks have not been breached or
compromised or do not contain defects or bugs that could result in
a disruption, breach, or other incident impacting our systems and
networks or those of third parties that support us and our
Advertising solutions. Security vulnerabilities, malicious code,
errors, or other bugs or defects in these third-party products,
services, and components could cause us to face increased costs,
claims, liability, and additional or new obligations, reduced
revenue, and harm to our reputation or competitive position. We and
our service providers may be unable to anticipate these techniques,
react, remediate or otherwise address any security vulnerability,
breach or other security incident in a timely manner, or implement
adequate preventative measures.

Further, we utilize AI technologies in our Advertising solutions
and Apps and may expand such use in the future. Our use of AI
technologies, and the use of AI technologies in third-party
products and services, may create additional cybersecurity risks or
increase cybersecurity risks, including risks of security breaches
and incidents, and related liability and harm to our reputation.
Further, AI technologies may be used in connection with certain
cybersecurity attacks, resulting in heightened risks of security
breaches and incidents.

In addition to our efforts to mitigate cybersecurity risks, we are
working to combat misuse of our services and user data by third
parties. We may not discover all such incidents or other
activities, in connection with our efforts to combat misuse or
otherwise, and we may be notified of such incidents or activity by
users, clients, the media, or other third parties. Such incidents
and activities have in the past, and may in the future, include the
processing of user data or use of our systems in manners
inconsistent with our terms, contracts or policies, the existence
of false or undesirable user accounts, improper advertising
practices, spamming, or unsecured datasets, and may also include
activities that threaten people's safety, or scraping, or data
harvesting. We may also be unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce
our policies or otherwise remediate or respond to any such
incidents effectively or in a timely manner. Any of the foregoing
developments, or any reports of them occurring or the perception
that any of them has occurred, could adversely affect user trust
and engagement, harm our brand and reputation, require us to change
our business practices, result in claims, demands, investigations,
and other proceedings by private parties or governmental actors,
and fines, penalties, and other liability or obligations, and
adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.

We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United
States and abroad relating to cybersecurity and data protection,
some of which provide a private right of action. Many jurisdictions
have enacted breach notification obligations, and our agreements
with certain customers or partners may require us to notify them or
fulfill other obligations in the event of a security breach or
incident. Affected users or government authorities could initiate
legal or regulatory actions against us in connection with any
actual or perceived security breaches or incidents or improper
access to or disclosure or other processing of data, which has
occurred in the past or may occur in the future, and which could
cause us to incur significant expense and liability, distract
management and technical personnel, and result in orders or consent
decrees forcing us to modify our business practices and to pay
fines or penalties. Such actual or perceived breaches or other
incidents or our efforts to remediate these events may also
                                39                                 
Table of C ontents
result in a decline in our active user base or engagement levels.
Any of these events could adversely affect our reputation,
business, financial condition, or results of operations.

Our insurance coverage may not extend to all types of privacy or
security breaches or other incidents, and it may be insufficient to
cover all costs and expenses associated with such events. Further,
such insurance may not continue to be available to us in the future
on economically reasonable terms, or at all, and insurers may deny
us coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one
or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance
coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies,
including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible
or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect
on our business, including our reputation, financial condition, or
results of operations.

We rely on third-party platforms to distribute our Apps and collect
revenue, and if our ability to do so is harmed, or such third-party
platforms change their policies in such a way that restricts our
business, increases our expenses, or limits the information we
derive from our Apps, our business, financial condition, and
results of operations could be adversely affected.

The mobile app ecosystem depends in part on a relatively small
number of third-party distribution platforms, such as the Apple App
Store, the Google Play Store, and Facebook, some of which are
direct competitors. We derive significant revenue from the
distribution of our Apps through these third-party platforms and
almost all of our IAPs are made through the payment processing
systems of these third-party platforms. We are subject to the
standard policies and terms of service of such third-party
platforms, which generally govern the promotion, distribution,
content, and operation of applications on such platforms. Each
platform provider has broad discretion to change and interpret its
terms of service and other policies with respect to us and other
mobile app companies, and those changes may be unfavorable to us. A
platform provider may also change its fee structure, add fees
associated with access to and use of its platform, alter how mobile
apps are labeled or are able to advertise on its platform, change
how the personal information of its users is made available to
developers on its platform, limit the use of personal information
for advertising purposes, restrict how users can share information
on its platform or across platforms, or significantly increase the
level of compliance or requirements necessary to use its platform.

For example, since 2021, Apple has implemented an application
tracking transparency framework that, among other things, requires
users' opt-in consent for certain tracking. While this framework
has not had a significant impact on our overall business, it may in
the future, including with respect to the effectiveness of our
advertising practices and/or our ability to efficiently generate
revenue for our Apps. We rely in part on IDFA to provide us with
data that helps our Advertising solutions better market and
monetize Apps. Apple also implemented new requirements for consumer
disclosures regarding privacy and data processing practices in
December 2020, which has resulted in increased compliance
requirements and could result in decreased usage of our App. In
light of the IDFA and transparency changes, we made changes to our
data collection practices. To the extent we are unable to utilize
IDFA or a similar offering, or if the transparency changes and any
related opt-in or other requirements result in decreases in the
availability or utility of data relating to Apps, our Advertising
solutions may not be as effective, we may not be able to continue
to efficiently generate revenue for our Apps, and our revenue and
results of operations may be harmed. Apple also incorporated new
SDK privacy controls into iOS 17, released in September 2023.

Similarly, in February 2022, Google announced its Privacy Sandbox
initiative for Android, a multi-year effort expected to restrict
tracking activity and limit advertisers' ability to collect app and
user data across Android devices. In January 2024, Google commenced
rolling out a Chrome feature called Tracking Protection, which
limits cross-site tracking. Additionally, in January 2024, Google
started to roll out new CMP requirements for ads served in the EEA
and UK, which require publishers using Google AdSense, Ad Manager,
or AdMob to use CMPs certified by Google and integrated with the
IAB's Transparency and Consent Framework when serving ads to users
in the EEA or the UK. According to Google, if publishers do not
adopt a Google-certified CMP, only limited ads will be eligible to
serve in the EEA and UK. To adapt to these changes, we released the
MAX SDK version 12.0.0. to support integration with Google's CMP
solution. While to date these third-party platform privacy changes
have had some impact on the discoverability of apps across these
platforms, and have had a relatively muted aggregate impact on our
results of operations, the ultimate impact of these or any similar
or future changes to the policies of Apple or Google may adversely
affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.

Distribution platform providers from time to time limit, suspend or
discontinue access to their platforms in connection with
violations, or perceived violations, of terms of service. In
addition, any change or deterioration in our relationship with such
distribution provider may impact our access to its platform. If one
of our distribution platform partners were to limit or discontinue
the distribution of our Apps on their platform, generally, or any
of our more successful Apps individually, it may adversely affect
our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
                                40                                 
Table of C ontents
We also rely on the continued popularity, user adoption, and
functionality of third-party platforms. In the past, some of these
platform providers have been unavailable for short periods of time
or experienced issues with their in-app purchasing functionality.
In addition, third-party platforms also impose certain file size
limitations, which may limit the ability of users to download some
of our larger Apps in over-the-air updates. Aside from these over-
the-air file size limitations, a larger game file size could cause
users to delete our mobile games once the file size grows beyond
the capacity of their devices’ storage limitations or could reduce
the number of downloads of these mobile games.

If issues arise with third-party platforms that impact the
visibility or availability of our Apps, our users’ ability to
access our Apps or our ability to monetize our Apps, or otherwise
impact the design or effectiveness of our Advertising solutions,
our business, financial condition, and results of operations could
be adversely affected.

We are highly dependent on our co-founder and chief executive
officer, as well as our senior management team. We operate a lean
organizational structure and our business and growth may be
adversely affected if we fail to attract, retain, and motivate key
personnel.

Our future success depends in significant part on the continued
service of our key management and engineering personnel, including
our co-founder, CEO, and Chairperson, Adam Foroughi. Our ability to
compete and grow depends in part on the efforts and talents of
these employees and executives, who are important to our vision,
strategic direction, culture, products, and technology. We do not
have employment agreements, other than offer letters, with Mr.
Foroughi or other members of our senior management team, and we do
not maintain key-man insurance for members of our senior management
team. The loss of Mr. Foroughi or any other member of our senior
management team could cause disruption and adversely affect our
business, financial condition, or results of operations.

We believe strongly in operating a lean organizational structure,
leveraging technology wherever possible, as it allows us to adapt
our business as needed and affords increased opportunity to our
employees. While this approach enhances efficiency and cost
control, it may also expose us to certain risks. While we believe
our lean culture allows us to move faster than other companies our
size, a lean workforce could limit our ability to scale operations
quickly in response to increased demand, develop new products or
services in a timely manner, or effectively manage multiple
initiatives simultaneously. Additionally, key employees often hold
multiple responsibilities, making us more vulnerable to disruptions
caused by turnover or unexpected absences. If we are unable to
attract, retain, and efficiently allocate personnel, our
operational capabilities, growth potential, and competitive
position could be adversely affected. Furthermore, as we expand, we
may need to hire additional employees and enhance our
infrastructure to support growth. Failure to do so in a timely or
effective manner could strain our existing workforce and negatively
impact our financial performance and strategic objectives.

In addition, our ability to execute our strategy depends in part on
our continued ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and
retain highly skilled employees, particularly in the competitive
fields of AI development, machine learning, product management,
engineering, and data science. We believe that our corporate
culture has been an important factor in our ability to hire and
retain key employees, and if we are unable to maintain our
corporate culture as we grow, we may be unable to foster the
innovation, creativity, and teamwork we believe we need to support
our growth. While we believe we compete favorably, competition for
highly skilled employees is intense, particularly in Silicon
Valley, where our headquarters is located. Interviewing, hiring,
and integrating new employees has been and will continue to be
challenging as we continue to navigate the global working
environment. If we are unable to identify, hire, and retain highly
skilled employees, our business, financial condition, and results
of operations could be adversely affected.

Our company culture has contributed to our success and if we cannot
maintain this culture as we grow, our business could be harmed.

We believe that our company culture has been critical to our
success and will be important for our continued growth. We face a
number of challenges that may affect our ability to sustain our
corporate culture, including: failure to identify, attract, reward,
and retain people in critical technical and leadership positions in
our organization who share and further our culture and values; the
increasing size and geographic diversity of our workforce;
competitive pressures to move in directions that may divert us from
our culture and values; the continued challenges of a rapidly-
evolving industry; the increasing need to develop expertise in new
areas of business that affect us; a negative perception of our
treatment of employees or our response to employee sentiment
related to political or social causes or actions of management; and
the integration of new personnel and businesses from acquisitions.
If we are not able to maintain our culture, we could lose the
innovation, passion, and dedication of our team and as a result,
our business, financial condition, and results of operations could
be adversely affected.
                                41

The failure to attract new clients, the loss of clients, or a
reduction in spending by these clients could adversely affect our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.

A significant portion of our revenue is Advertising Revenue and In-
App Advertising ("IAA") Revenue from our Apps. Advertising Revenue
is mostly from AppDiscovery and is generated from our advertisers,
typically on a performance-based basis, then shared with our
advertising publishers, typically on a cost per impression model.
IAA Revenue generated from our Apps comes from advertisers that
purchase ad inventory from our diverse portfolio of mobile games.
As is common in the advertising ecosystem, our clients do not have
long-term advertising commitments with us. Our success depends in
part on our ability to satisfy our advertising partners.

Revenue could also be impacted by a number of other factors,
including:

• our ability to attract and retain clients, including, for
example, in new markets such as e-commerce and social;

• our ability to improve the effectiveness and predictability of
our advertising and maintain and improve our AI-powered advertising
recommendation engine AXON;

• our ability to maintain or increase advertiser demand and third-
party publisher supply, the quantity or quality of advertisements
shown to users, or our pricing of advertisements;

• our ability to continue to increase user access to and engagement
with our Apps;

• mobile app changes or inventory management decisions we may make
that change the size, format, frequency, or relative prominence of
advertisements displayed on our Apps;

• changes in measuring or pricing of mobile or other advertising
markets;

• our ability to recruit, train, and retain personnel to support
continued growth of our Advertising solutions;

• our ability to establish and maintain our brand and reputation;

• loss of market share to our competitors, including if competitors
offer lower priced, more integrated, or otherwise more effective
products;

• the development and success of technologies designed to block the
display of advertisements or block our ad measurement tools, which
have in the past impacted and may in the future impact our
business, or technologies that make it easier for users to opt out
of behavioral targeting;

• the availability, accuracy, utility, and security of analytics
and measurement solutions offered by us or third parties that
demonstrate the value of our Advertising solutions to advertisers,
developers and publishers, or our ability to further improve such
tools;

• government actions or legislative, regulatory, or other legal
developments relating to AI or advertising, including developments
that may impact our ability to deliver, target, or measure the
effectiveness of advertising;

• changes that limit our ability to deliver, target, or measure the
effectiveness of advertising, including changes to policies by
mobile operating system and third-party platform providers, and the
degree to which users opt in or opt out of certain types of ad
targeting as a result of changes and controls implemented in
connection with such policy changes and with the E.U. General Data
Protection Regulation (the "GDPR"), ePrivacy Directive, the
California Consumer Privacy Act (the "CCPA") as amended by the
California Privacy Rights Act (the "CPRA"), similar U.S. privacy
laws in other states, and the Children’s Online Privacy Protection
Act (the "COPPA");

• decisions by clients to reduce their advertising due to concerns
about legal liability or uncertainty regarding their own legal and
compliance obligations, or due to negative publicity, regardless of
its accuracy, involving us, our user data practices, advertising
metrics or tools, our Advertising solutions or Apps, or other
companies in our industry; and

• the impact of macroeconomic conditions, including tariffs, trade
wars, inflation, high interest rates, and uncertainty in the global
banking and financial services markets, political uncertainty and
international conflicts around the world, such as in Ukraine and
the Middle East, as well as friction between the United States and
China, and responses thereto, and seasonality, whether in the
advertising industry in general, or among specific types of
advertisers or within particular geographies.

From time to time, certain of these factors have adversely affected
our revenue to varying degrees. The
                                42                                 
Table of C ontents
occurrence of any of these or other factors in the future could
result in a reduction in demand for our Advertising solutions and
use of our Apps, which may reduce the prices we receive for our
advertisements or cause clients to stop advertising with us
altogether, either of which would adversely affect our business and
results of operations. The failure to attract new clients, loss of
clients, or reduction in spending by clients could adversely affect
our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

The advertising ecosystem and mobile gaming are intensely
competitive. If clients or users prefer our competitors’ products
or services over our own, our business, financial condition, and
results of operations could be adversely affected.

We face significant competition in the advertising ecosystem and in
mobile gaming. We offer a suite of solutions for advertisers to get
their content discovered and downloaded by the right users,
optimize return on marketing spend, and maximize the monetization
of their engagement. We collect revenue from clients for fees paid
by advertisers, including developers, that use our Advertising
solutions and from the sale of advertising inventory of our Apps.
Advertisers often engage with several advertising platforms and
networks to purchase advertisements and developers often engage
with multiple tools to market and monetize their apps. Accordingly,
we face significant competition from traditional, online, and
mobile businesses that provide ad networks and platforms, mobile
apps and games, media, and other services for advertisers to reach
relevant audiences. We also face competition from providers of
developer tools that enable developers to reach their audiences or
manage or optimize their advertising campaigns. These companies
vary in size and include Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Unity
Software as well as various private companies, several of which are
also our partners and clients. Additionally, our studios build many
of our Apps using the development kits offered by Unity Software.
Changes in pricing or the terms on which developers engage with
companies in the mobile app ecosystem, such as the pricing changes
announced by Unity Software in September 2023, could negatively
impact our studios and the mobile app ecosystem generally. Clients
who are also competitors may decide to invest in their own
offerings rather than continue to use our Advertising solutions or
advertise on our Apps.

Additionally, we also compete with businesses that develop online
and mobile games and other mobile apps, which vary in size and
include companies such as Activision Blizzard (Microsoft), Tencent,
and Zynga (Take-Two Interactive), as well as other public and
private companies, many of which are also our partners and clients.
As we expand our global operations and mobile app offerings, we
increasingly face competition from high-profile companies with
significant online presences that may introduce new or expanded
offerings, such as Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Snap. In
addition, other large companies that to date have not actively
focused on mobile apps or gaming may decide to develop mobile apps
or gaming offerings, such as Amazon’s games platform, or partner
with other developers. Some of these current and potential
competitors have significantly greater resources that can be used
to develop, acquire, or brand additional mobile apps or gaming
alternatives, and may have more diversified revenue sources than we
do and therefore may be less severely affected by changes in
consumer preferences, regulations, or other developments that may
impact our business or industry.

Further, as there are relatively low barriers to entry to develop
and publish a mobile app, we expect new competitors to enter the
market and existing competitors to allocate more resources towards
developing and marketing competing games and apps. Because our
mobile games are free-to-play, our Apps compete primarily on the
basis of user experience rather than price. The proliferation of
apps makes it difficult for us to differentiate ourselves from our
competitors and compete for users and the success of our Apps will
depend in part on our Advertising solutions continuing to provide
effective marketing and monetization tools.

We also face competition for advertising spending and for the
discretionary spending, leisure time, and attention of our users
from game platforms such as personal computer and console games,
and other leisure time activities, such as television, movies,
music, sports, and the internet. During periods of macroeconomic
uncertainty, levels of advertising and discretionary spending have
historically decreased and are likely to decrease and therefore
this competition may intensify, which has at times harmed and may
in the future harm our revenue. In addition, non-game applications
for mobile devices, such as social media and messaging, television,
movies, music, dating, and sports, have become increasingly
popular, making the overall mobile app ecosystem highly fragmented
and making it more difficult for any mobile app to differentiate
itself. To the extent we explore entering into new markets or new
business opportunities in the advertising ecosystem, mobile gaming,
or otherwise, we may also compete with established businesses with
more experience in such areas. Increasing competition could result
in decreases in our App users, increased user acquisition costs,
lower engagement with our Apps, and loss of key personnel, all of
which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or
results of operations.

Some of our current and potential competitors may be domiciled in
different countries and subject to political, legal, and regulatory
regimes that enable them to compete more effectively than us,
particularly outside of the
                                43                                 
Table of C ontents
United States. Some of our current and potential competitors may
have greater resources, more diversified revenue streams, better
technological or data analytics capabilities, or stronger brands or
competitive positions in certain product segments, geographic
regions, or user demographics than we do. If clients or users
prefer our competitors’ products or services over our own, or if
our competitors are better able to adapt to changes in the
preferences of advertisers or users, regulations, or other
developments, our business, financial condition, and results of
operations could be adversely affected.

The advertising ecosystem and mobile gaming are subject to rapid
technological change, and if we do not adapt to, and appropriately
allocate our resources among, emerging technologies and business
models, our business, financial condition, and results of
operations could be adversely affected.

Technology changes rapidly in the advertising ecosystem and in
mobile gaming. Our future success depends in part on our ability to
adapt to trends and to innovate. To attract new clients and users
and increase revenue from our current clients and users, we may
develop new products or enter into new markets, such as e-commerce
or social, and we will need to enhance and improve our Advertising
solutions and Apps. Our ability to improve the effectiveness and
predictability of our advertising recommendations through
improvements to our AI-powered advertising recommendation engine
AXON is critical to our continuing success and future growth.
Enhancements of our existing technology and offerings, and new
offerings, may not be introduced in a timely or cost-effective
manner and may contain errors or defects, both of which could
adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.

Our business also currently depends in part on the growth and
evolution of the internet, especially mobile internet-enabled
devices. The number of people using mobile internet-enabled devices
has increased rapidly over time, and we expect that this trend will
continue. However, the markets in which we operate may not grow in
the way we anticipate. We must continually anticipate and adapt to
emerging technologies to stay competitive, including the
development of AI and its impacts on the advertising ecosystem and
mobile gaming. As the technological infrastructure for internet
access improves and evolves, consumers will be presented with more
opportunities to access apps and play games on a variety of devices
and platforms and to experience other leisure activities that may
compete with mobile apps. Forecasting the financial impact of these
emerging technologies and business models is inherently uncertain
and volatile. If we decide to support a new technology or business
model in the future, it may require partnering with a new platform,
technology, or business partner, which may be on terms that are
less favorable to us than those for traditional technologies or
business models.

To invest in a new technology, enter a new market or expand our
offerings, we must invest financial resources and management
attention. We may invest significant resources in a new offering,
entering a new market or in a strategic acquisition or partnership,
which could prove unsuccessful or prevent us from directing these
resources towards other opportunities. We may never recover the
often-substantial up-front costs of developing and marketing
emerging technologies or business models, or recover the
opportunity cost of diverting management and financial resources.
Further, our competitors may adopt an emerging technology or
business model more quickly or effectively than we do, creating
products that are technologically superior to ours or attract more
users than ours.

If, on the other hand, we do not continue to enhance our
Advertising solutions or Apps, or do not appropriately allocate our
resources amongst opportunities, or we otherwise elect not to
pursue new business models that achieve significant commercial
success, we may face adverse consequences. For example, we do not
currently offer our Apps on all devices or all gaming platforms. If
the devices on which our Apps are available decline in popularity
or become obsolete faster than anticipated, or if new platforms
emerge other than those on which our games are offered, we could
experience a decline in revenue and in our number of App users, and
we may not achieve the anticipated return on our development
efforts. It may take significant time and expenditures to shift
product development resources to new technologies, and it may be
more difficult to compete against existing products incorporating
such technologies. If new technologies render mobile devices
obsolete or we are unable to successfully adapt to and
appropriately allocate our resources amongst current and new
technologies, our business, financial condition, and results of
operations could be adversely affected.

Our Advertising solutions and Apps, as well as our internal
systems, rely on software and hardware that is highly technical,
and any errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities in these systems, or
failures to address or mitigate technical limitations in our
systems, could adversely affect our business, financial condition,
and results of operations.

Our Advertising solutions and Apps, as well as our internal
systems, rely on software and hardware, including AI technologies,
that are highly technical and complex. In addition, our Advertising
solutions and Apps, as well as our internal systems, depend in part
on the ability of such software and hardware to store, retrieve,
process, and manage immense amounts of data. The software and
hardware on which we rely has contained, and will in the
                                44

future contain, errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities and our systems
are subject to certain technical limitations that may compromise
our ability to meet our objectives. Some errors, bugs, or
vulnerabilities inherently may be difficult to detect and may only
be discovered after the code has been released for external or
internal use. Errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, design defects, or
technical limitations within the software and hardware on which we
rely have in the past led to, and may in the future lead to,
outcomes including a negative experience for clients and users who
use our offerings, compromised ability of our offerings to perform
in a manner consistent with our terms, contracts, or policies,
delayed product or App launches or enhancements, targeting,
measurement, or billing errors, compromised ability to protect data
and/or our intellectual property, or reductions in our ability to
provide some or all of our services. To the extent such errors,
bugs, vulnerabilities, or defects impact our Advertising solutions
or the accuracy of data in the Advertising solutions, our clients
may become dissatisfied with our offerings, our brand and
reputation may be harmed, and we may make operational decisions,
such as with respect to our Apps using such Advertising solutions
or any future strategic acquisition, that are based on inaccurate
data. Any errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, or defects in our systems
or the software and hardware on which we rely, failures to properly
address or mitigate the technical limitations in our systems, or
associated degradations or interruptions of service or failures to
fulfill our commitments to our clients may lead to outcomes
including damage to our reputation, increased product engineering
expenses, regulatory inquiries, litigation, or liability for fines,
damages, or other remedies, any of which could adversely affect our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Our business depends in part on our ability to maintain and scale
our technical infrastructure, and any significant disruption to our
Advertising solutions or Apps could damage our reputation, result
in a potential loss of engagement, and adversely affect our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Our reputation and ability to attract and retain our clients and
users depends in part on the reliable performance of our
Advertising solutions and Apps. We have in the past experienced,
and may in the future experience, interruptions in the availability
or performance of our offerings from time to time. Our systems may
not be adequately designed or may not operate with the reliability
and redundancy necessary to avoid performance delays or outages
that could be harmful to our business. If our offerings are
unavailable when users attempt to access them, or if they do not
load as quickly as expected, users may not use our offerings as
often in the future, or at all, which could adversely affect our
business and results of operations. As we continue to grow, we will
need an increasing amount of technical infrastructure, including
network capacity and computing power, to continue to satisfy our
needs and the needs of our clients and users. It is possible that
we may fail to continue to effectively scale and grow our technical
infrastructure to accommodate these increased demands, which may
adversely affect our user engagement and revenue growth.
Additionally, we rely on certain third-party providers for our
increasing network capacity and computing power needs, and if we
fail to properly anticipate our needs or secure sufficient capacity
at a reasonable cost, our ability to scale and grow our business,
or our profitability, could be negatively impacted. Our business
may be subject to interruptions, delays, or failures resulting from
natural disasters and other events outside of our control that
impact us or these third-party providers. If such an event were to
occur, users may be subject to service disruptions or outages and
we may not be able to recover our technical infrastructure and user
data in a timely manner to restart or provide our services. If we
fail to efficiently scale and manage our infrastructure, or if
events disrupt our infrastructure or those of our third-party
providers, our business, financial condition, and results of
operations could be adversely affected.

Our revenue has been concentrated in the mobile app ecosystem and
any failure to successfully expand and diversify our revenue
sources beyond the mobile ecosystem could adversely affect our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We face concentration risk in that our Advertising solutions and
Apps operate in the mobile app ecosystem and specifically mobile
gaming. As such, our business depends, in part, on the continued
health and growth of these app ecosystems. Further, a significant
amount of our total revenue is derived through a limited number of
third-party distribution platforms, such as the Apple App Store,
the Google Play Store, and Facebook. Because Facebook and Google
are also significant partners of Adjust, a deterioration in our or
Adjust’s relationship with such companies would have a greater
impact on our business, financial condition, and results of
operations. If any of these concentrated portions of our revenue
are harmed or are lost, our business, financial condition, and
results of operations could be adversely affected.

Our future growth may involve expansion into new business
opportunities, and any efforts to do so that are unsuccessful or
are not cost-effective could adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.

In the past, we have grown by expanding our offerings into new
business opportunities and we expect to
                                45                                 
Table of C ontents
continue to do so. We have dedicated resources to expanding into
adjacent business opportunities in which large competitors have an
established presence, such as e-commerce. Additionally, our future
growth may include expansion into additional features for our
advertisers and publishers, other mobile app sectors, social,
e-commerce or related markets, connected TV markets through Wurl,
OEM and carrier-related markets through our Array product
initiative, or other opportunities which may require significant
investment in order to launch and which may not be prove
successful. Further, any such expansion may subject us to new or
additional laws and regulations, compliance with which may be
burdensome and costly. Our future growth depends in part on our
ability to correctly identify areas of investment and to cost-
effectively execute on our plans. For example, we have developed
and continue to further develop our Advertising solutions to
support e-commerce advertisers. The expansion of our services to
this market is still in its early stages. We also generate revenue
through our Wurl CTV business which provides streaming content
distribution and advertising services. The market for CTV platforms
is relatively new and evolving and this market may develop slower
or differently than we expect. Further, there can be no assurance
that we will achieve broader adoption among e-commerce advertisers
or that we will effectively develop technology for our Advertising
solutions that will allow us to successfully expand into new
markets.

We have in the past and may in the future expend significant
resources in connection with strategic acquisitions and
partnerships to expand into new business opportunities. Even if
successful, the growth of any new business opportunity could create
significant challenges for our management and operational resources
and could require considerable investment. The deployment of
significant resources towards a new opportunity that proves
unsuccessful, or our inability to choose the correct investment
opportunities for our future, could adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.

Our business is subject to global economic, market, public health,
and geopolitical conditions as well as to natural disasters beyond
our control and could adversely affect our revenue and results of
operations.

General macroeconomic conditions, such as inflation, high interest
rates, or a recession or economic slowdown in the United States or
internationally, including those resulting from tariffs, trade
wars, uncertainty in the global banking and financial services
markets, political uncertainty and international conflicts around
the world, such as between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle
East, as well as friction between the United States and China,
could create uncertainty and adversely affect discretionary
consumer spending habits and preferences as well as advertising
spending. In addition, changes in macroeconomic conditions,
including those due to recent actual and proposed tariff increases
imposed by the United States on various trading partners, could
change consumer behavior and adversely affect advertising spending
and costs related to our operations. Specifically, the U.S. has
imposed significant new and escalated tariffs on products from
China since February 2025, significant new tariffs on many products
of Canada and Mexico since March 2025, and a global tariff on most
products from almost all other U.S. trading partners since April
2025; these policies have been fluid and the full economic impact
of these policies is currently uncertain. Our revenue is driven in
part by discretionary consumer spending habits and preferences, and
by advertising spending patterns. Historically, consumer purchasing
and advertising spending have each declined during economic
downturns and periods of uncertainty regarding future economic
prospects or when disposable income or consumer lending is lower.
In certain periods in 2022, we experienced the impacts of the
macroeconomic deterioration as advertisers more closely managed
budgets and reduced overall spend, which resulted in slowed growth
for our Advertising solutions. Uncertain economic conditions may
impact advertiser spending in future periods and may also adversely
affect our clients, which in turn may harm our business, financial
condition, and results of operations. In addition, the economic
conditions affecting the financial markets, and uncertainty in
global economic conditions may result in a number of adverse
effects including a low level of liquidity in domestic and global
markets, volatility in credit, equity, and currencies and
instability in the stock market. There could be a number of other
follow-on effects from these economic developments on our business,
including customer insolvencies, decreased demand for our marketing
solutions; decreased customer ability to pay their accounts, and
increased collections risk and defaults. We are particularly
susceptible to market conditions and risks associated with the
advertising ecosystem, including changes in user demographics, the
availability and popularity of other forms of entertainment, and
critical reviews and public tastes and preferences, which may
change rapidly and cannot necessarily be predicted.

Our business is subject to economic, market, public health, and
geopolitical conditions, as well as natural disasters beyond our
control. For example, we have a partner studio located in Belarus
and we have employees located in Israel and as a result of the
international conflict between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle
East, we have incurred and are likely to continue to incur costs to
support our partner studio and employees and address related
challenges. In addition, our management has spent time and
attention on these and related events and will continue to monitor
and assess the ongoing disruptions to our team members, our
management, and our operations, each of which could potentially
harm our business. We may also experience interruptions or delays
in
                                46                                 
Table of C ontents
the services they provide to us as a result of such geopolitical
volatilities.

Further, we have operations in China and the continuing tension
between the U.S. and China may impact our business and results of
operations in the future. The U.S. government has restricted the
ability to send certain products and technology to China without an
export license. In many cases, these licenses are subject to a
policy of denial and will not be issued. While our current products
are not restricted by these controls, such controls or future
restrictions could impact our business in the future. Additionally,
the U.S. government also continues to add additional entities in
China and other countries to restricted party lists impacting the
ability of U.S. companies to engage with these entities. In
addition, the Chinese government has retaliated, and may continue
to retaliate, to recent changes in U.S. tariffs and export controls
in ways that could indirectly impact our business..

While not currently material to the operation of our business,
management and our board of directors have discussed and assessed,
and will continue to discuss and assess, any risks related to
international conflicts around the world, such as in Ukraine and
the Middle East, as well as tension between the United States and
China, including but not limited to, risks related to
cybersecurity, sanctions, regulatory changes, and personnel based
in affected regions to ensure we are prepared to react to new
developments or further sanctions as they arise. If we are unable
to promptly or properly react to new developments in these and
other international regions, our business, financial condition, and
results of operations could be adversely affected.

Our principal offices are located in Palo Alto, an area known for
earthquakes and susceptible to fires, and are thus vulnerable to
damage. All of our facilities are also vulnerable to damage from
natural or manmade disasters, including power loss, earthquakes,
fires, explosions, floods, communications failures, terrorist
attacks, contagious disease outbreak (such as the COVID-19
pandemic), and similar events. If any disaster were to occur, our
ability to operate our business at our facilities could be impaired
and we could incur significant losses, recovery from which may
require substantial time and expense.

We plan to continue to consider opportunities to expand and
diversify our operations through strategic acquisitions and
partnerships, and we recently provided an indication of interest to
the President of the United States to explore a purchase of TikTok
in all markets outside of China. We face a number of risks related
to strategic transactions we may pursue.

We will continue to consider opportunities to expand and diversify
our operations with additional strategic acquisitions or
partnerships, strategic collaborations, joint ventures, or
licensing arrangements. As we continue to grow, these transactions
may be larger and require significant investments, such as our
acquisitions of Adjust, the MoPub business, and Wurl.

In April 2025, we confirmed that we had provided an indication of
interest to the President of the United States to explore a
purchase of TikTok in all markets outside of China. This indication
of interest is preliminary and there can be no assurance that a
transaction involving us will proceed. If our proposal to combine
with TikTok does not result in a definitive agreement, this may be
viewed negatively by investors, securities analysts, customers and
other strategic partners and our stock price could decline. Whether
or not we enter into a definitive agreement to combine with TikTok,
the announcement and pendency of the proposal, the market reaction
to our proposal and related discussions regarding our proposed
combination with TikTok could cause disruptions in our business.
For example, significant management attention may be directed
toward discussions and processes related to a potential business
combination, which could adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations. Even if we have an opportunity
to enter into a business combination transaction with TikTok, the
consummation of that transaction may be subject to various closing
conditions and either party may be unable to satisfy one or more of
the closing conditions. Further, the exploration of a possible
transaction with TikTok could result in us incurring significant
costs, expenses and fees, including for professional services and
other transaction costs, for which we will have received little or
no benefit, should no such transaction take place, and that may be
viewed negatively or impact our financial results which could have
a negative impact on our stock.

We may be unable to identify or complete prospective acquisitions
or partnerships for many reasons, including our ability to identify
suitable targets, increasing competition from other potential
acquirers, the effects of consolidation in our industries,
potentially high valuations of acquisition candidates, and the
availability of financing to complete larger acquisitions. Even if
we do complete any such transactions, we may incur significant
costs, such as professional service fees or publisher bonuses.
Further, completing larger acquisitions or other strategic
transactions can involve significantly more risk in that such
transactions involve complicated integrations and require
significant management attention to complete, and these large
strategic transactions could introduce additional exposure to
regulatory and compliance risk. In addition, applicable antitrust
laws and other regulations may limit our ability to acquire
targets, particularly larger targets, or force us to divest an
acquired business. If we are unable to identify suitable targets or
complete acquisitions, or if such acquisitions lead to heightened
regulatory
                                47                                 
Table of C ontents
or compliance risk, our growth prospects could be adversely
affected, and we may not be able to realize sufficient scale and
technological advantages to compete effectively in all markets.

To complete large strategic transactions, we may need to spend
significant amounts of cash, which may not be available to us on
acceptable terms, if at all, or which could lead us to incur
additional debt (and increased interest expense), assume contingent
liabilities or amortization expenses related to intangible assets,
or write-offs of goodwill and intangible assets. In addition, we
may need to issue significant amounts of equity or equity-linked
consideration, which would dilute our current stockholders’
ownership and could adversely affect the price of our Class A
common stock. For example, we have expressed an interest in
purchasing TikTok in all markets outside of China, and such a
transaction, if it were to take place, would likely require the
issuance of a significant amount of equity. Further, we generally
devote more time and resources towards performing diligence on
larger transactions and may be required to devote more resources
towards regulatory requirements in connection with such
transactions. To the extent that we do not perform sufficient
diligence on a larger acquisition or such a transaction does not
generate the expected benefits, our business, financial condition,
and results of operations will be harmed, and to a greater extent
than would occur with a smaller transaction.

Absent such strategic transactions, we would need to undertake
additional development or commercialization activities at our own
expense. If we elect to fund and undertake such additional efforts
on our own, we may need to obtain additional expertise and
additional capital, which may not be available to our company on
acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to do any of the
foregoing, we may not be able to develop our Advertising solutions
and Apps effectively or achieve our expected product roadmap on a
timely basis, which could adversely affect our business, financial
condition, and results of operations.

The benefits of a strategic acquisition or partnership may also
take considerable time to develop, and we cannot be certain that
any particular strategic acquisition or partnership will produce
the intended benefits. If we are unable to identify and complete
strategic acquisitions or partnerships or realize the anticipated
benefits from such transactions, our business, financial condition,
and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Our international operations are subject to increased challenges
and risks.

We expect to continue to expand our international operations in the
future by opening new offices, entering into strategic partnerships
with new international game studios, acquiring companies that may
have international operations, and providing our Apps in additional
countries and languages. For example, our resources are located
throughout the world, including in areas with less certain legal
and regulatory regimes or more potential risks, such as Belarus,
China, Israel and Vietnam and with partners in Russia and Ukraine.
Expanding our international operations may subject us to risks
associated with:

• recruiting and retaining talented and capable management and
employees in foreign countries;

• challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural
differences;

• increased risk of loss, data breaches or cybersecurity attacks
from our global operations;

• developing and customizing Advertising solutions and Apps that
appeal to the tastes and preferences of users in international
markets;

• the inability to offer certain Advertising solutions or Apps in
certain foreign countries;

• competition from local mobile app developers with intellectual
property rights and significant market share in those markets and
with a better understanding of user preferences;

• utilizing, protecting, defending, and enforcing our intellectual
property rights;

• negotiating agreements with local distribution platforms that are
sufficiently economically beneficial to us and protective of our
rights;

• the inability to extend proprietary rights in our brand, content,
or technology into new jurisdictions;

• implementing alternative payment methods for features and virtual
goods in a manner that complies with local laws and practices and
protects us from fraud;

• compliance with applicable foreign laws and regulations,
including anti-bribery laws, privacy and data protection laws, AI
laws, and laws relating to content and consumer protection (for
example, the United Kingdom’s Office of Fair Trading’s 2014
principles relating to IAPs in free-to-play games that are directed
toward children 16 and under);

• credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud;
                                48                                 
Table of C ontents
• currency exchange rate fluctuations;

• protectionist laws and business practices that favor local
businesses in certain countries;

• double taxation of our international earnings and potentially
adverse tax consequences due to changes in the tax laws in the
United States or the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate;

• political, economic, macro-economic climate and social
instability, including impacts related to labor, supply chain
disruptions, inflation, and as a result of war, terrorism, or armed
conflict, including international conflicts around the world, such
as between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East, as well as,
increasing friction between the United States and China and the
impacts on their respective regions and the regional and global
economy;

• public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which can
result in varying impacts to our employees, clients, users,
advertisers, app developers, and business partners internationally;

• higher costs associated with doing business internationally,
including costs related to local advisors;

• export or import regulations; and

• trade and tariff restrictions.

Our ability to successfully gain market acceptance in any
particular international market is uncertain and, in the past, we
have experienced difficulties and have not been successful in all
the countries we have entered. If we are unable to continue to
expand internationally or manage the complexity of our global
operations successfully, our business, financial condition, and
results of operations could be adversely affected.

We have experienced significant growth through strategic
acquisitions and partnerships, and we face risks related to the
integration of such acquisitions and the management of such growth.

As part of our growth strategy, we have frequently acquired
companies, businesses, personnel, and technologies, and we intend
to continue to evaluate and pursue strategic acquisitions and
partnerships. For example, we acquired Adjust GmbH in April 2021,
Twitter's MoPub business in January 2022 and Wurl, Inc. in April
2022. Each acquisition requires unique approaches to integration
due to, among other reasons, the structure of the acquisition, the
size, locations, and cultural differences among their team and
ours, and has required, and will continue to require, attention
from our management team. As we continue to grow, the size of our
acquisitions and investments has increased and may continue to
increase. In addition to the larger purchase prices associated with
such acquisitions and investments, larger acquisitions and
investments may also require additional management resources to
integrate more significant and often more complex businesses into
our company. We will continue to explore and evaluate additional
acquisitions, some of which may be the same size or even larger in
scale and investment than our recent acquisitions.

Our future success depends in part on our ability to integrate
these acquisitions and manage these businesses, partnerships, and
transactions effectively. If we are unable to obtain the
anticipated benefits or synergies of such acquisitions, or we
encounter difficulties integrating acquired businesses with ours,
our business, financial condition, and results of operations could
be adversely affected.

Challenges and risks from such strategic acquisitions and
partnerships include:

• diversion of our management’s attention in the acquisition and
integration process, including oversight over acquired businesses
which continue their operations under contingent consideration
provisions in acquisition agreements;

• declining employee morale and retention issues resulting from
changes in compensation or benefits, or changes in management,
reporting relationships, or future performance;

• the need to integrate the operations, systems, technologies,
products, and personnel of each acquired company, the
inefficiencies and lack of control that may result if such
integration is delayed or not implemented, and unforeseen
difficulties and expenditures that may arise in connection with
integration;

• costs associated with onboarding clients of an acquired business;

• the need to implement internal controls, procedures, and policies
appropriate for a larger, U.S.-based public company at companies
that prior to acquisition may not have as robust controls,
procedures, and policies, in particular, with respect to the
effectiveness of internal controls, cyber and information security
practices and incident response plans, compliance with privacy,
data protection, and other
                                49                                 
Table of C ontents
regulations protecting the rights of clients and users, and
compliance with U.S.-based economic policies and sanctions which
may not have previously been applicable to the acquired company’s
operations;

• the difficulty in accurately forecasting and accounting for the
financial impact of an acquisition transaction, including
accounting charges, write-offs of deferred revenue under purchase
accounting, and integrating and reporting results for acquired
companies that have not historically followed GAAP;

• the implementation of restructuring actions and cost reduction
initiatives to streamline operations and improve cost efficiencies;

• the fact that we may be required to pay contingent consideration
in excess of the initial fair value, and contingent consideration
may become payable at a time when we do not have sufficient cash
available to pay such consideration;

• in the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate
operations across different cultures and languages and to address
the particular economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks
associated with specific countries as well as tax risks that may
arise from the acquisition;

• increasing legal, regulatory, and compliance exposure, and the
additional costs related to mitigate each of those, as a result of
adding new offices, employees and other service providers, benefit
plans, equity, job types, and lines of business globally; and

• liability for activities of the acquired company before the
acquisition, including intellectual property, commercial, and other
litigation claims or disputes, security vulnerabilities, violations
of laws, rules and regulations, including with respect to employee
classification, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown
liabilities.

If we are unable to successfully integrate and manage our
acquisitions and strategic partnerships, we may not realize the
expected benefits of such transactions or become exposed to
additional liabilities, and our business, financial condition, and
results of operations could be adversely affected.

We have entered into an agreement to sell our Apps portfolio, and
we face a number of risks related to such proposed sale.

On May 7, 2025, we, along with our subsidiaries Morocco, Inc. and
AppLovin GmbH (collectively, the “Sellers”) entered into a Purchase
Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Tripledot (“Purchaser Parent”) and
its subsidiaries Eton Games Inc. and Tripledot Group Holdings
Limited (collectively, with Purchaser Parent, the “Purchasers”). On
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Agreement,
Sellers will transfer the equity interests of certain wholly-owned
subsidiaries that are engaged in our mobile gaming business (the
“Gaming Business”) to Purchasers, for total consideration (the
“Purchase Price,” and such sale, together with the other
transactions contemplated by the Agreement, the “Transactions”)
consisting of (i) $400.0 million in cash consideration, comprised
of (a) $150.0 million to be paid in cash at the closing of the
Transactions (the “Closing”) and (b) a $250.0 million secured
promissory note to be issued by Eton Games Inc. (collectively with
any other U.S. subsidiaries of Purchaser Parent designated as a co-
Borrower thereunder, “Borrowers”) to us or our designated affiliate
at the Closing (the “Promissory Note”), and (ii) equity
consideration comprised of ordinary shares of Purchaser Parent
representing approximately 20% of the fully-diluted equity
capitalization of Purchaser Parent at the Closing. Purchaser Parent
anticipates financing a portion of the cash Purchase Price payable
at the Closing with debt.

The terms of the Promissory Note provide for a maturity of 18
months from the Closing, with no amortization. The Borrowers are
permitted to voluntarily prepay the outstanding principal amount of
the Promissory Note, in whole or in part, without premium or
penalty. The advance under the Promissory Note bears interest at a
rate per annum equal to eleven percent (11%). As of the Closing,
the obligations of the Borrowers under the Promissory Note will be
guaranteed by all U.S. and U.K. subsidiaries of the Purchaser
Parent, subject to certain exceptions, and secured by (i)
substantially all assets of the Borrowers and the U.S. guarantors
and (ii) a pledge by Tripledot Group Holdings Limited of the equity
interests held by it in each Borrower and U.S. guarantor, in each
case subject to permitted liens and certain customary exceptions.
Within 90 days after the Closing, the obligations of the Borrowers
under the Promissory Note will also be guaranteed by Purchaser
Parent and secured by (a) substantially all assets of the U.K.
guarantors and (b) a share pledge by Purchaser Parent of the equity
interests held by it in each U.K. guarantor and U.S. guarantor, in
each case subject to permitted liens and certain customary
exceptions.

The Transactions may be delayed, and may ultimately not be
completed, due to a number of factors, including the failure to
obtain regulatory approvals from the requisite government entities
or the failure to satisfy the other conditions to the completion of
the Transactions, If the Transactions are terminated or otherwise
not completed, we
                                50                                 
Table of C ontents
would not realize any of the expected benefits of the Transactions
and may suffer other consequences that could adversely affect our
business, results of operations and stock price, including, among
others:

• we will have incurred and may continue to incur costs relating to
the Transactions, many of which are payable by us whether or not
the Transactions are completed;

• matters related to the Transactions require substantial
commitments of time and resources by our management team and
numerous others throughout our organization, which could otherwise
have been devoted to other opportunities;

• we may be subject to legal proceedings related to the
Transactions or the failure to complete the Transactions, which
could be time consuming and expensive, could divert our
management’s attention away from our regular business and, if any
lawsuit is adversely resolved against us, could have a material and
adverse effect on our financial condition;

• the failure to complete the Transactions may result in negative
publicity and a negative perception of us in the investment
community, which could negative impact on our stock price; and

• any disruptions to our business resulting from the announcement
and pendency of the Transactions, including any adverse changes in
our relationships with our customers, partners or employees, may
continue to intensify in the event the Agreement is not
consummated.

Further, while the Transactions are pending, we are subject to
contractual restrictions relating to our operation of the Gaming
Business. Even if the Transactions are completed, to the extent the
Promissory Note is outstanding, we will face risks associated with
the repayment of such note. For additional information regarding
the Agreement, the Transactions, see the section titled
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations—Recent Developments".

Our strategic acquisitions and partnerships may expose us to tax
risks.

From time to time, we have acquired and may acquire companies,
assets, businesses, and technologies and we have entered into and
may enter into other strategic partnerships and transactions. We
face a variety of tax risks related to such transactions, including
that we may be required to make tax withholdings in various
jurisdictions in connection with such transactions or as part of
our continuing operations following a transaction, and that the
companies or businesses we acquire may cause us to alter our
international tax structure or otherwise create more complexity
with respect to tax matters. Additionally, while we typically
include indemnification provisions in our definitive agreements
related to strategic acquisitions and partnerships, these
indemnification provisions may be insufficient in the event that
tax liabilities are greater than expected or in areas that are not
fully covered by indemnification. If we are unable to adequately
predict and address such tax issues as they arise, our business,
financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely
affected.

We have entered into strategic partnerships with mobile gaming
studios, and a failure to maintain such relationships may harm our
ability to launch new Apps as well as our brand and reputation.

From time to time, we have entered into strategic partnerships with
mobile gaming studios in addition to those studios that are wholly-
owned. We have historically allowed our strategic partner studios
to continue their operations with a degree of autonomy. In certain
of these transactions, we have bought games from such partner
studios and entered into development agreements whereby such
partner studios provide us support in developing and improving
games. These agreements typically have a fixed term, after which
our partner studios may choose not to continue working with us. Any
deterioration in our relationship with partner studios may harm our
ability to monetize the games we purchase or develop and launch
future mobile games developed by partner studios and may lead to
such partner studios choosing not to renew their partnerships with
us or continue to develop new games or support existing games.
Further, if a partner studio becomes dissatisfied with us, our
brand and reputation may be harmed and we may have more difficulty
entering into similar partnerships in the future. Additionally, our
international partner studios may be located in areas with less
certain legal and regulatory regimes or more potential risks, which
may increase our costs to maintain such strategic partnership. If
we are unable to maintain any of these partnerships, we may be
required to invest significant resources in expanding our other
studios or entering into agreements with additional mobile gaming
studios in order to continue producing the same volume and quality
of Apps, and our business, financial condition, and results of
operations could be adversely affected. Our pending sale of our
mobile gaming business includes these strategic partnerships. The
Agreement for the proposed sale is subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of certain conditions, including regulatory approvals, and
we may not be able to complete the proposed transaction or do so in
a timely manner. Failure to complete the pending sale may result in
negative
                                51

publicity. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and cause
the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.

If we are unable to launch or acquire new Apps and successfully
monetize them, or continue to improve the experience and
monetization of our existing Apps, our business, financial
condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Our Apps portfolio depends in part on launching or acquiring, and
continuing to service, mobile apps that users will download and
spend time and money using. We have devoted and we may in the
future continue to devote substantial resources to the research,
development, analytics, and marketing of our Apps. Our development
and marketing efforts are focused on improving the experience of
our existing Apps, developing new Apps, and successfully monetizing
our Apps. Our Apps generate revenue primarily through the sale of
advertising, a substantial portion of which comes from other mobile
gaming clients, and IAPs. For Apps distributed through third-party
platforms, we are required to share a portion of the proceeds from
in-game sales with the platform providers, which share may be
subject to changes or increases over time. In order to achieve and
maintain our profitability, we need to generate sufficient revenue
from our existing and new Apps to offset our ongoing development,
marketing, and other operating expenses.

Successfully monetizing our Apps is difficult and requires that we
deliver user experiences that a sufficient number of users will pay
for through IAPs or we are able to otherwise sufficiently monetize
our Apps, including by serving IAA. The success of our Apps depends
in part on unpredictable and volatile factors beyond our control
including user preferences, competing apps, new third-party
platforms, and the availability of other entertainment experiences.
If our Apps do not meet user expectations or if they are not
brought to market in a timely and effective manner, our business
and results of operations could be adversely affected.

In addition, our ability to successfully launch or acquire Apps and
their ability to achieve commercial success will depend in part on
our ability to:

• effectively and efficiently market our Apps to existing and new
users;

• achieve a positive return on investment from our marketing and
user acquisition costs or achieve organic user growth;

• adapt to changing trends, user preferences, new technologies, and
new feature sets for mobile and other devices, including
determining whether to invest in development for any new
technologies, and achieve a positive return on the costs associated
with such adaptation;

• continue to adapt mobile app feature sets for an increasingly
diverse set of mobile devices, including various operating systems
and specifications, limited bandwidth, and varying processing power
and screen sizes;

• achieve and maintain successful user engagement and effectively
monetize our Apps;

• develop mobile games that can build upon or become franchise
games and expand and enhance our mobile games after their initial
releases;

• develop Apps other than mobile games;

• identify and execute strategic acquisitions and partnerships;

• attract advertisers to advertise on our Apps;

• partner with third-party platforms and obtain featuring
opportunities;

• compete successfully against a large and growing number of
competitors;

• accurately forecast the timing and expense of our operations,
including mobile app and feature development, marketing, and user
acquisition;

• minimize and quickly resolve bugs or outages;

• acquire, or invest in, and successfully integrate high quality
mobile app companies or technologies;

• retain and motivate talented and experienced developers and other
key personnel from such acquisitions and investments; and

• optimize the value of our Apps portfolio, including actions we
may take that reduce Apps Revenue in order to seek higher margins
and the effects of the review on morale and personnel.
                                52

These and other uncertainties make it difficult to know whether we
will succeed in continuing to develop and launch new Apps. Even if
successful, certain genres of mobile apps, such as casual games,
may have a relatively short lifespan. Further, as our Apps expand
into additional genres of mobile games or additional categories of
mobile apps, we will face risks as well as market, legal, and
regulatory challenges specific to those genres or categories. For
example, in mid-core games, there is typically a higher upfront
investment prior to the launch of a game compared to casual games,
which means publishing a new game in that genre will expose us to
greater risks as our financial condition and results of operations
will be more significantly adversely affected to the extent such a
game does not become popular and commercially successful. If we are
not successful in launching new mobile games or expanding into
other genres of mobile games or categories of mobile apps, our
business, financial condition, and results of operations could be
adversely affected.

If we fail to retain existing users or add new users cost-
effectively, or if our users decrease their level of engagement
with Apps, our business, financial condition, and results of
operations could be adversely affected.

The size of our user base and the level of user engagement with our
Apps are critical to our success. Our results of operations have
been and will continue to be significantly determined by our
success in acquiring and engaging App users. We expect that the
number of our App users may fluctuate or decline as a result of
apps divestitures or other actions we have taken in connection with
our review of our Apps portfolio, or in one or more markets from
time to time, particularly in markets where we have achieved higher
penetration rates or where the macroeconomic conditions have been
negatively impacted. For example, we have reduced our user
acquisition spend for our portfolio of Apps as we increased our
desired return goals, which has contributed to a decline in MAPs
compared to periods before such adjustments. In addition, if people
do not perceive our Apps as useful or entertaining, we may not be
able to attract or retain users or otherwise maintain or increase
the frequency and duration of their engagement, which could harm
our revenue. A number of mobile apps that achieved early popularity
have since seen their user bases or user engagement levels decline.
There is no guarantee that we will not experience a similar erosion
of our App users or user engagement levels. Our user engagement
patterns have changed over time, and user engagement can be
difficult to measure, particularly as we introduce new and
different Apps. Any number of factors can adversely affect user
growth and engagement, including if:

• users increasingly engage with mobile apps offered by competitors
or mobile apps in categories other than those of our Apps;

• we fail to introduce new Apps or features that users find
engaging or that achieve a high level of market acceptance or we
introduce new Apps, or make changes to existing Apps that are not
favorably received;

• users feel that their experience is diminished as a result of the
decisions we make with respect to the frequency, prominence,
format, size, and quality of advertisements that we display;

• users have difficulty installing, updating, or otherwise
accessing our Apps as a result of actions by us or third parties;

• we are unable to continue to develop Apps that work with a
variety of mobile operating systems and networks;

• there are changes mandated by legislation, government and
regulatory authorities, or litigation that adversely affect our
products or users; and

• questions about the quality of our Apps, our data practices or
concerns related to privacy and sharing or other processing of user
data, safety, security, or other factors.

Additionally, we expect it will become increasingly difficult and
more expensive for us to acquire users for our Apps for a variety
of reasons, including the increasingly competitive nature of the
mobile app ecosystem and the significant amount of time and
attention users are dedicating to competing entertainment options.
Further, we believe that the changes that Apple has implemented
during the last several years to its platform, particularly the
removal of the Top Grossing rankings and decreasing the prominence
of the Top Free rankings as well as transparency and IDFA changes,
have adversely affected the number of organic downloads of our
Apps. If our competitors increase their user acquisition spending,
we could experience higher costs per an install for our Apps, which
would adversely affect our revenue and margins. Furthermore, our
spending on user acquisition is based on certain assumptions about
their projected behavior, particularly for new Apps for which we do
not have similar Apps in our portfolio to aid us in our modeling
efforts. If we are unable to grow our user base and increase our
user engagement levels, or unable to do so cost effectively, our
business, financial condition, and results of operations
                                53

could be adversely affected.

We have experienced recent rapid growth, which may not be
indicative of our future growth. We may be unable to effectively
manage the growth of our business, which could adversely affect our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We have experienced rapid growth in the scale, scope, and
complexity of our business. For example, our Advertising Revenue
has expanded rapidly, in particular since the launch of our AI-
powered advertising recommendation engine, AXON. Our growth in any
prior period should not be relied upon as an indication of our
future performance, as we may not be able to sustain our growth
rate in the future. Even if our revenue continues to increase, we
expect that our revenue growth rate may decline in the future as a
result of a variety of factors, including because of more difficult
comparisons to prior periods and the saturation of the market. The
overall growth of our revenue depends in part on our ability to
execute on our growth strategies.

Additionally, the growth and expansion of our business has placed
and continues to place a significant strain on our management,
operations, financial infrastructure, and corporate culture. Our
future success depends in part on our ability to manage this
expanded business. If not managed effectively, this growth could
result in the over-extension of our management systems and
information technology systems and our internal controls and
procedures may not be adequate to support this growth. Failure to
adequately manage our growth in any of these ways may cause damage
to our brand and reputation and adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.

Our business depends in part on our ability to increase IAPs,
manage the economies in our Apps and respond to changes with
respect to IAPs, and any failure to do so could adversely affect
our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Our Apps portfolio depends in part on our ability to increase the
amount of IAPs in our Apps, which requires our studios to
effectively design mobile games and other apps that create features
and virtual goods for which users will pay. Users make IAPs because
of the perceived in-app value of virtual goods, which is dependent
on the relative ease of obtaining an equivalent good by playing our
mobile games. The perceived in-app value of these virtual goods can
be impacted by various actions that we take in the mobile games
including offering discounts for virtual goods, giving away virtual
goods in promotions, or providing easier non-paid means to secure
these goods. Managing virtual economies is difficult and relies on
our assumptions and judgment. Further, changes in user preferences,
including with respect to how they interact with mobile apps and
general views towards IAPs, could decrease levels of spending on
IAPs on our Apps and in the mobile app ecosystem generally. If we
fail to manage our virtual economies properly or fail to promptly
and successfully respond to any disruption in such economies, our
reputation may be harmed and our users may be less likely to play
our mobile games and to purchase virtual goods from us in the
future, which could adversely affect our business, financial
condition, and results of operations.

In addition, changes in the policies of Apple, Google, or other
third-party platforms, or changes in accounting policies
promulgated by the SEC, and national accounting standards bodies
affecting software and virtual goods revenue recognition, could
further significantly affect the way we report revenue related to
IAPs, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Any
changes in user, third-party platform, or regulator views towards
IAPs, or any inability by us to respond to changing trends with
respect to IAPs, could adversely affect our business, financial
condition, and results of operations.

We anticipate increasing our operating expenses in the future, and
we may not be able to achieve or maintain our profitability in any
given period. If we cannot achieve or maintain our profitability,
our business could be adversely affected.

Although we have been profitable on a GAAP basis and had positive
cash flow from operations in certain prior periods, we may not
always achieve sufficient revenue or manage our expenses in order
to achieve positive cash flow from operations or profitability in
any given period. Our operating expenses may continue to rise over
the long term as we implement additional initiatives designed to
increase revenue, potentially including: developing our Advertising
solutions and technology stack, launching Apps, strategic
acquisitions and partnerships, international expansion, hiring
additional employees, and taking other steps to strengthen and grow
our company. We are likely to recognize costs associated with these
investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits, and the
return on these investments may be lower, or may develop more
slowly, than we expect. We also anticipate that the costs of
acquiring new clients and mobile app users, and otherwise marketing
our Advertising solutions and Apps, will continue to rise. Further,
we may continue to incur significant costs in connection with
strategic acquisitions and partnerships, which costs may increase
or become more concentrated to the extent we enter into larger
transactions. If we are not able to maintain positive cash flow in
the long term, we may require additional financing,
                                54                                 
Table of C ontents
which may not be available on favorable terms or at all, and which
may be dilutive to our stockholders. If we are unable to generate
adequate revenue growth and manage our expenses, we may incur
significant losses in the future and may not be able to maintain
positive cash flow from operations or profitability.
We generally do not have long-term agreements with our clients.
Our clients are not required to enter into long-term agreements
with us and may choose to stop using our Advertising solutions at
any time. For example, typically our advertising agreements can be
executed in as little as one day and can be terminated for
convenience on two days’ notice. In order to continue to grow our
Advertising solutions, we must consistently provide offerings that
clients see as valuable and choose to use. If we fail to maintain
our relationships with our clients, or if the terms of these
relationships become less favorable to us, our results of
operations would be harmed. Additionally, as certain of our clients
are also our competitors, these clients may choose to invest in
their own offerings rather than continue to use our Advertising
solutions. Any failure to maintain our relationships with clients
could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and
results of operations.

If our Apps do not meet user expectations, or contain objectionable
content, our reputation, business, financial condition, and results
of operations could be adversely affected.

Expectations regarding the quality, performance, and integrity of
our Apps are high. We must continually adapt to changing user
preferences including the popularity of various game categories,
style of play, and IAP options. Users may be critical of our Apps,
business models, or business practices for a wide variety of
reasons, including perceptions about gameplay, fairness, game
content, features, or services. Independent industry analysts may
publish reviews of our Apps from time to time, as well as those of
our competitors, and perception of our Apps in the marketplace may
be significantly influenced by these reviews. We have no control
over what users or these industry analysts report. If users and
industry analysts negatively respond to our Apps or changes that we
make to our Apps, or provide negative reviews of our Apps, our
reputation, business, financial condition, and results of
operations could be adversely affected.

Further, despite reasonable precautions, some users may be offended
by certain mobile app content, advertisements displayed in our Apps
or by the treatment of other users. For example, if users believe
that an advertisement displayed in an App contains objectionable
content, we could experience damage to our brand and reputation and
users could refuse to play such game and pressure platform
providers to remove the App from their platforms. While such
content may violate our terms and we may subsequently remove it,
our brand and reputation may nonetheless be harmed and our clients
may become dissatisfied with our services. Furthermore, steps that
we may take in response to such instances, such as temporarily or
permanently shutting off access of a user to our Apps, could
adversely affect our business and results of operations. Any
failure to meet user expectations or provide our Apps without
objectionable content could adversely affect our reputation,
business, financial condition, and results of operations.

If we do not successfully or cost-effectively invest in and
maintain awareness of the AppLovin brand, our business, financial
condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.

We believe that investing in and maintaining the AppLovin brand is
critical to maintaining and creating favorable relationships with,
and our ability to attract, new clients, and key personnel.
Increasing awareness of the AppLovin brand will depend largely upon
our marketing efforts and our ability to successfully differentiate
our Advertising solutions from the offerings of our competitors. In
addition, successfully globalizing and extending our brand requires
significant investment and extensive management time. If we fail to
maintain and increase brand awareness and recognition of our
Advertising solutions, our business, financial condition, and
results of operations could be adversely affected.

Third parties with whom we do business may be unable to honor their
obligations to us or their actions may put us at risk.

We rely on third parties for various aspects of our business,
including demand-side platforms, agencies, advertising partners,
and publishers who use our Advertising solutions. Their actions may
violate our contracts, policies, and applicable laws and
regulations, or may otherwise put our business and reputation at
risk. Demand-side platforms may be given access to personal
information in order to bid on advertising inventory, and they may
misappropriate and engage in unauthorized use of our information,
technology, or customers' data. In violation of our policies,
advertisers may enable the serving of ads that contain prohibited,
restricted, or inappropriate content, or content that otherwise
fails to adhere to country-specific laws, rules, or regulations. We
also work with advertisers that operate sports gambling apps, apps
that involve real money gambling, and apps in other regulated
industries and markets, each of which imposes additional regulatory
requirements on these advertisers, which they may not
                                55                                 
Table of C ontents
comply with. A vast amount of publishers attempt to use our
Advertising solutions, a number of which may attempt to monetize
prohibited, restricted, or inappropriate content, or may engage or
attempt to engage in fraudulent or other unlawful activity in
violation of our policies, which in turn imposes additional
operational costs to protect our platform, may trigger additional
law enforcement or other inquiries, may put our reputation at risk,
and may otherwise adversely affect our business, financial
condition, and results of operations.

The failure of these third parties to provide or maintain adequate
services and technologies could result in a disruption to our
business operations. Further, disruptions in the mobile application
industry or financial markets, economic downturns, and poor
business decisions may adversely affect our partners and may
increase their propensity to engage in fraud or other unlawful
activity which could harm our business or reputation, and they may
not be able to honor their obligations to us, or we may cease our
arrangements with them.
                                                                   
  Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters                    
                                                                   
We are subject to laws and regulations concerning privacy,
information security, data protection, consumer protection,
advertising, tracking, targeting, and protection of minors, and
these laws and regulations are continually evolving. Our actual or
perceived failure to comply with these laws and regulations could
adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.

We receive, store, and process personal information and other data,
including data relating to individuals and households, and we
enable our users to share their personal information with each
other and with third parties, including within our Apps. Numerous
federal, state, and local laws around the world address privacy and
the collection, storing, sharing, use, disclosure, deletion,
protection, and other processing of personal information and other
data, including data relating to individuals and households, the
scope of which are changing, subject to differing interpretations,
and may be inconsistent between jurisdictions or conflict with
other obligations.

Various government and consumer agencies have called for, or sought
to implement, new regulation and changes in industry practices
relating to the collection and processing of information concerning
consumer behavior, including by restricting certain targeted
advertising practices. For example, the GDPR, which became
effective in May 2018, created new individual privacy rights and
imposed worldwide obligations on companies processing personal data
of European Union ("EU") users, which has created a greater
compliance burden for us and other companies with European users,
and subjects violators to substantial monetary penalties. For
example, the GDPR and other similar regulations require companies
to give specific types of notice and in some cases seek consent
from data subjects to collect and use their data for certain
purposes, including interest-based advertising. The United Kingdom
has implemented legislation that substantially implements the GDPR
and which also provides for substantial monetary penalties. In June
2021, the European Commission announced a decision of “adequacy”
concluding that the United Kingdom ensures an equivalent level of
data protection to the GDPR, which generally permits personal data
flows from the European Economic Area ("EEA") to the United
Kingdom. Such adequacy decision must, however, be renewed after
four years and may be modified or revoked in the interim. In
October 2022, the United Kingdom announced its plans to depart from
the GDPR and implement its own framework, and United Kingdom
lawmakers have proposed legislation that would cause its data
protection framework to deviate from the GDPR in certain respects.
We cannot fully predict how United Kingdom data protection laws or
regulations may develop in the medium to longer term, nor the
impacts of divergent laws and guidance regarding EU and United
Kingdom data protection law.

With regard to transfers to the United States of personal data from
our employees and European users and other third parties, we
historically relied upon the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield
programs as well as standard contractual clauses approved by the EU
Commission (the "SCCs"); however, the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and
the SCCs have been subject to legal challenge, and on July 16,
2020, the Court of Justice of the EU held in the Schrems II case
that the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield was invalid, and imposed
obligations in connection with use of the SCCs. EU regulators also
have issued guidance that we and other companies must consider and
undertake when using the SCCs. On June 4, 2021, the European
Commission adopted new SCCs to reflect GDPR requirements. The
United Kingdom’s Information Commissioner’s Office also has issued
new standard contractual clauses for which implementation is
required. Further, the Austrian, French, Italian, and Danish data
protection authorities have indicated that use of Google Analytics
by European website operators involves the unlawful transfer of
personal data to the United States. In March 2022, the EU and U.S.
agreed in principle upon a new EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework
(“EU-U.S. DPF”). On July 10, 2023, the European Commission adopted
an adequacy decision in relation to the EU-U.S. DPF, allowing it to
be used to legitimize EU-U.S. personal data transfers for
participating entities. The United Kingdom and U.S. also have
established a UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF (the “UK Extension”),
effective October 12, 2023, whereby entities participating in the
EU-U.S. DPF, may rely upon the UK Extension to legitimize United
Kingdom-U.S. personal data transfers. Further, on July 17, 2023,
the Swiss-U.S. Data
                                56                                 
Table of C ontents
Privacy Framework (“Swiss-U.S. DPF”), which provides for a means of
legitimizing personal data transfers from Switzerland to the U.S.,
entered into effect. We are self-certified under the EU-U.S. DPF,
Swiss-U.S. DPF, and the UK Extension. The EU-U.S. DPF has faced
legal challenge, and it and the Swiss-U.S. DPF and UK Extension may
be subject to further legal challenges. The European Commission’s
adequacy decision regarding the EU-U.S. DPF provides that the
EU-U.S. DPF will be subject to future reviews and may be subject to
suspension, amendment, repeal, or limitations to its scope by the
European Commission. The SCCs and other cross-border data transfer
mechanisms may also be the subject of additional legislative
activity and regulatory guidance. We and many other companies may
need to implement different or additional measures to establish or
maintain legitimate means for the transfer and receipt of personal
data from the EEA, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, or other
jurisdictions to the United States, and we may, in addition to
other impacts, experience additional costs associated with
increased compliance burdens, and we and our clients face the
potential for regulators to apply different standards to the
transfer of personal data from various jurisdictions to the United
States, and to block, or require ad hoc verification of measures
taken with respect to, certain data flows. We also may find it
necessary to engage in contract negotiations with third parties
that aid in processing data on our behalf, to address cross-border
data transfer matters. We may not be able to find alternative
service providers which could limit our ability to process personal
data from impacted jurisdictions and increase our costs and/or
impact our Advertising solutions, Apps, or other offerings. We and
our clients may face a risk of enforcement actions by data
protection authorities relating to personal data transfers. Any
such enforcement actions could result in substantial costs and
diversion of resources, distract management and technical
personnel, and adversely affect our business, financial condition,
and results of operations. Similar to the GDPR, in September 2020,
Brazil enacted the Brazilian General Data Protection Law. China has
enacted a new data privacy law known as PIPL, effective November 1,
2021, which adopts a stringent data transfer regime requiring,
among other things, data subject consent for certain data
transfers. Any of these developments may have an adverse effect on
our business.

Moreover, there are increasing restrictions in the United States on
certain personal sensitive data transfers to certain foreign
countries. The Department of Justice recently finalized a final
rule implementing Executive Order 14117, effective April 8, 2025,
which prohibits data transfer of personal identifiers, precise
geolocation data, biometric identifiers, health data, and financial
data over a certain bulk threshold to identified countries of
concern (i.e., China, Hong Kong, Macau, Cuba, Iran, North Korea,
Russia, and Venezuela). The rule also restricts data brokerage
agreements, investment agreements, employment agreements, and
vendor agreements involving such data and countries of concern.
Violations of the rule may be punishable by criminal and/or civil
sanctions and may result in exclusion from participation in federal
and state programs. These data transfer restrictions may create
operational challenges and legal risks for our business,
particularly with regard to China, where we have operations.

Another example of increasingly stringent privacy legislation is
California’s passage of the CCPA, which went into effect on January
1, 2020, and created new privacy rights for residents, including a
private right of action for data breaches. The CPRA was approved by
California voters in November 2020, went into effect on January 1,
2023, and significantly modified the CCPA, resulting in further
uncertainty. Additionally, other states in the U.S. have proposed
or enacted laws addressing privacy and cybersecurity, many of which
are comprehensive statutes containing obligations similar to the
CCPA and CPRA, that have taken effect or will take effect in coming
years. Certain of these laws provide for private rights of action,
which may increase the likelihood of class action litigation, that
could also adversely affect our reputation, business, financial
condition, and results of operations. The U.S. federal government
is also contemplating federal privacy legislation. Our efforts to
comply with the CCPA, as modified by the CPRA, and other existing
and future legal requirements have required us and will continue to
require us to devote significant operational resources and incur
significant costs and expenses. Our compliance and oversight
efforts regarding privacy, data protection, and security will
require significant time and attention from our management and
board of directors.

Further, children’s privacy has been a focus of recent enforcement
activities and subjects our business to potential liability that
could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or
operating results. Enforcement of COPPA, which requires companies
to obtain parental consent before collecting personal information
from children known to be under the age of thirteen or from child-
directed websites or online services, has increased in recent
years, and the FTC has finalized modifications to its rules
implementing COPPA that become effective June 23, 2025, and for
which compliance with most provisions is required as of April 22,
2026. These modifications may subject us to additional liability
and require us to dedicate additional compliance resources and
modify certain policies and practices. In addition, the GDPR
prohibits certain processing of the personal information of
children under the age of thirteen to sixteen (depending on
jurisdiction) without parental consent where consent is used as the
lawful basis for processing that personal information. The CCPA, as
amended and supplemented by the CPRA, requires companies to obtain
the consent of children in California under the age of sixteen (or
parental consent for children under the age of thirteen) before
selling their personal information. There also may be various laws,
                                57                                 
Table of C ontents
regulations, industry standards, codes of conduct, or other actual
or asserted obligations relating to children’s privacy to which we
may be, or be asserted to be, subject, or that may otherwise impact
our business and operations. For example, the United Kingdom’s Age
Appropriate Design Code ("AADC") is one such regulatory framework
that has been adopted in the United Kingdom that focuses on online
safety and protection of children’s privacy online, and similar
frameworks are being considered in other jurisdictions. Although we
take reasonable efforts to comply with applicable laws and
regulations and certain other standards, we may in the future face
claims under COPPA, the GDPR, the CCPA, the CPRA, or other laws,
regulations, or other actual or asserted obligations relating to
children’s privacy.

We endeavor to comply with industry standards and are subject to
the terms of our privacy-related obligations and commitments to
users and third parties. We strive to comply with all applicable
laws, policies, legal obligations, and certain industry codes of
conduct relating to privacy and data protection, to the extent
reasonably attainable. However, it is possible that these or other
actual or asserted obligations relating to privacy, data
protection, or information security may be interpreted and applied
in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another
and may conflict with other rules or our practices. It is also
possible that laws, policies, legal obligations, or industry codes
of conduct may be implemented, modified, or interpreted in manners
that could prevent us from offering services to categories of
users, such as residents of a certain jurisdiction or may make it
costlier or more difficult for us to do so. Any failure or
perceived failure by us to comply with our terms of service or
privacy policy, or with applicable laws, regulations, or legal,
contractual, or other actual or asserted obligations to users or
third parties, concerning privacy, information security, data
protection, consumer protection, or protection of minors; or our
privacy-related legal obligations, or any compromise of security
that results, or is perceived to result, in the unauthorized
release or transfer of personal information or other user data, may
result in governmental enforcement actions or other proceedings,
claims, demands, and litigation by private parties, or public
statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and
could cause our users to lose trust in us, which could adversely
affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
Additionally, if third parties we work with, such as users,
developers, vendors, service providers, or other business partners
violate applicable laws or our policies, such violations may also
put our users’ information at risk and could in turn adversely
affect our reputation, business, financial condition, and results
of operations.

Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign laws, many
of which are unsettled and still developing, which could subject us
to claims or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial
condition, and results of operations.

We are subject to a variety of laws in the United States and
abroad, and it is possible that a number of laws and regulations
may be adopted or construed to apply to us in the United States and
elsewhere that could affect our business and restrict the
advertising ecosystem or development of our technologies, including
state and federal laws regarding antitrust, consumer protection,
electronic marketing, protection of minors, data protection, and
privacy, communications, content suitability, distribution,
competition, taxation, intellectual property, machine learning and
AI, money transmission, money laundering, investment screening,
export, national security, and climate change, which are
continuously evolving and developing and any such policy and
regulatory changes could impose operational and compliance burdens.
The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be
applicable to us are often uncertain and evolving and may be
conflicting, particularly laws outside the United States. There is
a risk that existing or future laws may be interpreted in a manner
that is not consistent with our current practices and which could
adversely affect our business. As our Advertising solutions grow
and evolve, including through the use of and integration of AI
technologies, and our Advertising solutions and our Apps are used
in a greater number of countries and on a larger scale, we may also
become subject to new laws and regulations in additional
jurisdictions or jurisdictions may claim that we are required to
comply with their laws and regulations. The regulation of AI
technologies is a relatively new and evolving area of law which we
may become subject to as we continue to explore the use of AI
technologies in our current and future products. For example, in
the EU, the EU Artificial Intelligence Act imposes a regulatory
framework for the companies' development and use of AI systems, and
numerous state laws in the U.S. have been proposed, and in certain
cases enacted, regulating aspects of the development and use of AI
systems. Beyond the EU and U.S., many other countries have proposed
AI-related legal frameworks. There is a risk that existing or
future laws may be interpreted in a manner that is not consistent
with our current practices and which could adversely affect our
business.

With respect to our Apps, we are potentially subject to a number of
foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect the offering
of certain types of content, such as content that depicts violence,
the social casino game genre, or loot boxes, many of which are
ambiguous or still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that
could adversely affect our business or expose us to liability. Some
state attorneys general as well as other international regulatory
bodies have brought and may continue to bring legal actions against
social casino app developers and
                                58                                 
Table of C ontents
the third-party distribution platforms for such apps. Further,
several jurisdictions have been regulating and continue to regulate
the use of loot boxes in mobile games. Loot boxes are a commonly
used monetization technique in free-to-play mobile games in which a
user can acquire a virtual loot box, typically through mobile game
play or by using virtual goods, but the user does not know which
virtual good(s) he or she will receive (which may be a common,
rare, or extremely rare item, and may be a duplicate of an item the
user already has in his or her inventory) until the loot box is
opened. The user will always receive one or more virtual goods when
he or she opens the loot box, but the user does not know exactly
which item(s) until the loot box is opened. In April 2018, each of
the Belgian Gaming Commission and the Dutch Gambling Authority
declared that loot boxes as implemented in certain games by other
companies that they reviewed constituted illegal gambling under
each country’s laws. Further, the Federal Trade Commission (the
"FTC") has examined consumer protection issues related to loot
boxes and various other jurisdictions, including certain U.S.
states, Australia, Brazil, and the United Kingdom are reviewing or
have indicated that they intend to review the legality of loot
boxes and whether they constitute gambling. Additionally, in 2021,
Germany approved a new Youth Protection Act, that came into effect
on May 1, 2021, which makes it unlawful to sell video games that
contain loot boxes to minors. In some of our mobile games, certain
mechanics may be deemed as “loot boxes”. New regulation by the FTC,
U.S. states, or other international jurisdictions could require
that these game mechanics be modified or removed from games or that
such apps be changed entirely, both of which could increase the
costs of operating our mobile games, impact user engagement and
monetization, or otherwise adversely affect our business. In
addition, the increased attention focused upon liability issues as
a result of lawsuits and legislative proposals could harm our
reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business. It is
difficult to predict how existing or new laws may be applied to
these or similar game mechanics or genres. Further, laws or
regulations may vary significantly across jurisdictions.

Furthermore, the growth and development of electronic commerce and
virtual goods may prompt calls for more stringent consumer
protection laws that may impose additional burdens on companies
such as ours conducting business through the internet and mobile
devices. For example, China implemented a new policy in September
2021 that restricts online gaming for those under age 18 to one
hour in the evening on Fridays, weekends and public holidays. We
anticipate that scrutiny and regulation of our industry will
increase and we will be required to devote legal and other
resources to addressing such regulation. For example, existing laws
or new laws regarding the marketing of IAPs, labeling of free-to-
play mobile games, or regulation of currency, banking institutions,
unclaimed property or money transmission may be interpreted to
cover our mobile games and the virtual currency, goods, or payments
that we receive. We may also expand into new business opportunities
that subject us to additional laws and regulations. As such, we may
be required to seek licenses, authorizations, or approvals from
relevant regulators, the granting of which may be dependent on us
meeting certain capital and other requirements and we may be
subject to additional regulation and oversight, all of which could
significantly increase our operating costs. Changes in current laws
or regulations or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the
United States or elsewhere regarding these activities may lessen
the growth of the advertising ecosystem. Any costs incurred as a
result of adapting to laws and regulations, or as a result of
liability in connection therewith, could adversely affect our
business, financial condition, reputation and results of
operations.

The development and use of AI in our business, combined with an
uncertain regulatory environment, may adversely affect our
business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations.

We use AI technologies in connection with the development of our
Advertising solutions, including our latest AI-powered advertising
recommendation engine, AXON, and other product offerings, as well
as in other aspects of our business, and we will continue to invest
in the expansion of our AI capabilities, including possibly
generative AI. These technologies are complex and rapidly evolving,
and the development of AI technologies can require significant
investment. Expanding our AI capabilities subjects us to many of
the risks discussed elsewhere in this Risk Factors section,
including risks relating to rapid technological change, the highly
technical nature of software, and competition.

Additionally, the introduction of AI technologies into new or
existing products or other offerings may result in new or enhanced
governmental or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, confidentiality,
privacy, data protection, or security risks, social or ethical
concerns, or other complications that could adversely affect our
business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations.
The impact of AI technology on intellectual property ownership and
licensing rights, including copyright, has not been fully addressed
by U.S. courts or other federal or state laws or regulations, and
the use of third-party AI technologies in connection with our
products and services may result in exposure to claims of copyright
infringement or other intellectual property misappropriation. AI
technologies, including generative AI, may create content that is,
or is perceived to be, deficient, inaccurate, biased, offensive,
unethical, or otherwise flawed. Our customers or others may rely on
or use this content to their detriment, which may expose us to
brand or reputational harm, competitive harm, and/or legal
liability.
                                59

We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and similar
anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, and non-compliance with such
laws could subject us to criminal penalties or significant fines
and adversely affect our business and reputation.

We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the "FCPA"),
the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. § 201, the
U.S. Travel Act, and similar anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws
applicable in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Anti-
corruption and anti-bribery laws have been enforced aggressively in
recent years, are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies, their
employees, and third party business partners, representatives, and
agents from promising, authorizing, making or offering improper
payments or other benefits, directly or indirectly, to government
officials and others in the private sector in order to influence
official action, direct business to any person, gain any improper
advantage, or obtain or retain business. As we continue to expand
our business internationally, our risks under these laws increase.

We and our employees, third-party business partners,
representatives, and agents may have direct or indirect
interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or
state-owned or affiliated entities and we may be held liable for
the corrupt or other illegal activities of our employees, third-
party business partners, representatives, and agents, even if we do
not explicitly authorize such activities. These laws also require
that we keep accurate books and records and maintain internal
controls and compliance procedures designed to prevent any such
actions. While we have policies and procedures to address
compliance with such laws, we cannot assure you that our employees,
third-party business partners, representatives, and agents will not
take actions in violation of our policies or applicable law, for
which we may be ultimately held responsible and our exposure for
violating these laws increases as our international presence
expands and as we increase sales and operations in foreign
jurisdictions.

Any allegations or violations of the FCPA or other applicable anti-
corruption laws could result in whistleblower complaints, adverse
media coverage, investigations, loss of export privileges, severe
criminal or civil sanctions, suspension or disbarment from U.S.
government contracts, substantial diversion of management’s
attention, significant legal fees and fines, severe criminal or
civil sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees,
disgorgement of profits, other sanctions and remedial measures, and
prohibitions on the conduct of our business, any of which could
adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, and
results of operations. Responding to any investigation or action
will likely result in a significant diversion of management’s
attention and resources and significant defense costs and other
professional fees.

We are subject to governmental export controls and economic
sanctions laws that could impair our ability to compete in global
markets or subject us to liability if we violate the controls.

Our Advertising solutions and Apps may be subject to U.S. export
controls, including the Export Administration Regulations. Under
these regulations, exports of our products and services as well as
the underlying technology may require export authorizations,
including by license, a license exception, or other appropriate
government authorizations, and the filing of a classification
request or self-classification report to use a license exception,
as applicable.

Furthermore, our activities are subject to U.S. economic sanctions
laws and regulations administered by the U.S. Department of
Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control that prohibit the
provision of services and the export of hardware, software, and
technology to embargoed jurisdictions or sanctioned parties without
the required export authorizations. These laws, regulations, and
sanctions are rapidly evolving and may be in conflict across
international jurisdictions, leading to uncertainty and difficulty
in achieving full compliance. Should we violate such existing or
similar future sanctions or regulations, we may be subject to
substantial monetary fines or suffer reputational damage and other
penalties that could negatively impact our business. If we need to
obtain any necessary export licenses or other authorizations for a
particular sale, the process may be time-consuming and may result
in the delay or loss of opportunities to sell our products.

We take precautions to prevent our products and services and the
underlying technology from being provided, deployed or used in
violation of export control and sanctions laws and regulations,
including implementation of IP address blocking and sanctioned
person screening, and continue to evaluate and further enhance our
policies and procedures relating to export control and sanctions
compliance. However, we cannot assure you that our policies and
procedures relating to export control and sanctions compliance will
prevent violations in the future by us or our partners or agents.
If we are found to be in violation of U.S. sanctions or export
control regulations, including failure to obtain appropriate
import, export, or re-export licenses or permits, it can result in
significant penalties and government investigations, as well as
reputational harm and loss of business. Knowing and willful
violations can result in possible incarcerations for responsible
employees and managers.

In addition to the United States, various other countries regulate
the import and export of certain encryption
                                60                                 
Table of C ontents
and other technology, including import and export licensing
requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to
distribute our products or could limit our clients’ ability to
implement our products in those countries. Changes in our
Advertising solutions or Apps, or future changes in export and
import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our
products and the underlying technology in international markets,
prevent our clients with global operations from deploying our
products globally, or, in some cases, prevent the export or import
of our products to certain countries, governments, or persons
altogether.

Our growth strategy includes further expanding our operations and
client and user base in international markets and acquiring
companies that may operate in countries where we do not already do
business. Such acquisitions may subject us to additional or
expanded export regulations. Further, any change in export or
import regulations or controls, economic sanctions or related
legislation, or change in the countries, governments, persons, or
technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in
decreased use of our products by, or in our decreased ability to
export or sell our products to, existing or potential clients with
global operations. Any decreased use of our products or limitation
on our ability to export or sell our products in major
international markets could adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.

Changes in tax laws or tax rulings could adversely affect our
effective tax rates, business, financial condition, and results of
operations.

We are subject to tax laws, regulations, and rulings in the United
States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Changes in tax laws or
tax rulings, or changes in interpretations of existing laws, in the
tax regimes that we are subject to or operate under could cause us
to be subject to additional income-based taxes and non-income taxes
(such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, digital services, net
worth, property, and goods and services taxes), which in turn could
adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
For example, beginning in 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017
requires U.S. research and experimental expenditures to be
capitalized and amortized ratably over a five-year period. Any such
expenditures attributable to research conducted outside the U.S.
must be capitalized and amortized over a 15-year period. In
addition, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the "IRA"), enacted
in August 2022, imposed a one-percent non-deductible excise tax on
repurchases of stock that are made by U.S. publicly traded
corporations on or after January 1, 2023, which may affect our
share repurchase program. The IRA also imposes a 15% minimum tax on
global adjusted financial statement income for tax years beginning
after December 31, 2022 for certain large companies. Finally, a
number of other countries and organizations, such as the
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, have enacted
changes to existing tax laws or new laws that could impact our tax
obligations, including a framework that imposes a 15% global
minimum tax, which has been implemented into the domestic laws of
some jurisdictions in the European Union, among other
jurisdictions, and is being considered for implementation by other
countries. These or other new rules could result in double taxation
of our international earnings. Any significant changes to our
future effective tax rate could adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.
We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.
Our tax obligations are based in part on our corporate operating
structure and intercompany arrangements, including the manner in
which we develop, value, manage, and use our intellectual property
and the valuation of our intercompany transactions. The tax laws
applicable to our business, including the laws of the United States
and other jurisdictions, are subject to interpretation and certain
jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws in new ways
in an effort to raise additional tax revenue. Our existing
corporate structure and intercompany arrangements have been
implemented in a manner we believe is in compliance with current
prevailing tax laws. However, the taxing authorities of the
jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies
for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements,
which could impact our worldwide effective tax rate and adversely
affect our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover,
changes to our corporate structure and intercompany agreements,
including through future acquisitions, or divestitures, in addition
to changes in domestic or international tax laws (such as the
proposed 15% global minimum tax, which has been implemented into
the domestic laws of some jurisdictions) could impact our worldwide
effective tax rate and adversely affect our business, financial
condition, and results of operations.

In addition, we are subject to federal, state, and local taxes in
the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant
judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and our
worldwide provision for taxes. During the ordinary course of
business, there are many activities and transactions for which the
ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our tax obligations and
effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the
relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, principles,
and interpretations, including those relating to income tax nexus,
by our earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where
we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in
jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, and by
challenges to our
                                61                                 
Table of C ontents
intercompany relationships and transfer pricing arrangements. The
relevant taxing authorities may disagree with our determinations as
to the income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions.
If such a disagreement were to occur, and our position were not
sustained, we could be required to pay additional taxes, interest,
and penalties, which could result in one-time tax charges, higher
effective tax rates, reduced cash flows and lower overall
profitability of our business, with some changes possibly affecting
our tax obligations in future or past years. We believe that our
financial statements reflect adequate reserves to cover such a
contingency, but there can be no assurances in that regard.

Taxing authorities may successfully assert that we should have
collected or in the future should collect sales and use, value
added or similar taxes, and any such assessments could adversely
affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.

We collect sales tax and value added taxes in a number of
jurisdictions. Sales and use, value added, digital service, and
similar tax laws and rates vary greatly by jurisdiction. Certain
jurisdictions in which we do not collect such taxes may assert that
such taxes are applicable or that our presence in such
jurisdictions is sufficient to require us to collect taxes, which
could result in tax assessments, penalties, and interest, and we
may be required to collect such taxes in the future. Such tax
assessments, penalties, and interest or future requirements may
adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Further, following the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in June of 2018
in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc., U.S. states may require an out-
of-state seller with no in-state property or personnel to collect
and remit sales tax on sales to the state’s residents, which may
permit wider enforcement of sales tax collection requirements.
Therefore, the application of existing or future laws relating to
sales tax to our business, or the audit of our business and
operations with respect to such taxes or challenges of our
positions by taxing authorities, all could result in increased tax
liabilities for us or our customers, create additional
administrative burdens for us, put us at a competitive disadvantage
if such states do not impose similar obligations on our
competitors, and decrease our future sales, which could adversely
affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.

We may not be able to realize tax savings from our international
structure, which could materially and adversely affect our results
of operations.

In 2023, we completed an international restructuring that included
the inter-entity license of certain intellectual property and other
assets used in the business to our Singapore subsidiary. This
structure may be challenged by tax authorities, and if such
challenges are successful, the tax savings we expect to realize
could be adversely affected. If substantial modifications to our
international structure or the way we operate our business are
made, such as if future acquisitions or divestitures occur, if
changes in domestic and international tax laws negatively impact
the structure (such as the 15% global minimum tax, which has been
implemented into the domestic laws of some jurisdictions), if we do
not operate our business consistent with the structure and
applicable tax provisions, if we fail to achieve our revenue and
profit goals, or if the international structure or our application
of arm's-length principles to intercompany arrangements is
successfully challenged by the U.S. or foreign tax authorities, our
effective tax rate may increase, which could materially and
adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

If we are found liable for content that is distributed through or
advertising that is served through our Advertising solutions or
Apps, our business could be adversely affected.

As a distributor of content, we face potential liability for
negligence, copyright, patent or trademark infringement, public
performance royalties, or other claims based on the nature and
content of materials that we distribute. The Digital Millennium
Copyright Act (the "DMCA") is intended, in part, to limit the
liability of eligible service providers for caching, hosting, or
linking to user content that includes materials that infringe
copyrights or other rights. We rely on the protections provided by
the DMCA in conducting our business. Similarly, Section 230 of the
Communications Decency Act ("Section 230") protects online
distribution platforms, such as ours, from actions taken under
various laws that might otherwise impose liability on the platform
provider for what content creators develop or the actions they take
or inspire.

However, the DMCA, Section 230, and similar statutes and doctrines
that we may rely on in the future are subject to uncertain judicial
interpretation and regulatory and legislative amendments. Future
regulatory or legislative changes may ultimately require us to take
a more active approach towards content moderation, which could
diminish the depth, breadth, and variety of content we offer and,
in so doing, reduce our revenue. Moreover, the DMCA and Section 230
provide protections primarily in the United States. If the rules
around these statutes and doctrines change, if international
jurisdictions refuse to apply similar protections, or if a court
were to disagree with our application of those rules to our
business, we could incur liability and our business could be
adversely affected. If we become liable for these types of claims
as a result of the content that is included in our Apps or the
advertisements that are served through our Advertising solutions,
then our business may be adversely affected.
                                62                                 
Table of C ontents
Litigation to defend these claims could be costly and the expenses
and damages arising from any liability could adversely affect our
business. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover these types of
claims or any liability that may be imposed on us.

In addition, regardless of any legal protections that may limit our
liability for the actions of third parties, we may incur
significant legal expenses and other costs if copyright holders
assert claims, or commence litigation, alleging copyright
infringement against our third-party developers. While we prohibit
mobile apps without distribution rights from the copyright holder,
and we maintain processes and systems for the reporting and removal
of infringing mobile apps, such prohibitions, processes, and
systems may not always be successful. If other developers,
licensees, platform providers, business partners, and personnel are
influenced by the existence of types of claims or proceedings and
are deterred from working with us as a consequence, our ability to
maintain or expand our business, including through international
expansion plans, could be adversely affected.

We have incurred and will continue to incur increased costs and
demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and
regulations affecting public companies, which could adversely
affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.

We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act,
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act"), and the
rules and regulations of the SEC and the Nasdaq listing standards.
The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual,
quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and
results of operations. Compliance with these requirements has
increased and will continue to increase our legal, accounting, and
financial compliance costs and increase demand on our systems,
making some activities more time-consuming and costly. We expect
these rules and regulations to make it more expensive for us to
obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be
required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur
substantially higher costs to maintain the same or similar
coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract
and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors
or as our executive officers. As a public company, we have incurred
and expect to incur significant expenses and devote substantial
management effort toward ensuring compliance with the auditor
attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
In addition, as a public company, we may be subject to shareholder
activism, which can lead to substantial costs, distract management,
and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we
cannot currently anticipate.

As a result of disclosure of information in our public filings with
the SEC as required of a public company, our business and financial
condition has become more visible, which has resulted in and may in
the future result in threatened or actual litigation, including by
competitors and other third parties. For example, beginning in
March 2025, several complaints were filed by certain alleged
stockholders against us, our board of directors, and/or certain of
our officers alleging violations of the Exchange Act concerning
statements made regarding our Advertising solutions and our
financial growth. If such claims are successful, our business,
financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely
affected, and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are
resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources
necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our
management and our board of directors and adversely affect our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Legal or regulatory proceedings and settlements could cause us to
incur additional expenses or otherwise adversely affect our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We are involved in or may become involved in claims, suits,
government investigations, including formal and informal inquiries
from government authorities and regulators, and proceedings arising
in the ordinary course of our business, including actions with
respect to intellectual property claims, securities claims,
privacy, data protection, or law enforcement matters, tax matters,
labor and employment claims, commercial and acquisition-related
claims, and other matters. We may become the subject of
investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests for information,
actions, and audits in the United States, Europe, and around the
world, particularly in the areas of privacy, data protection, law
enforcement, consumer protection, and competition, as we continue
to grow and expand our operations. In addition, we are currently,
and may in the future be, subject to regulatory orders or consent
decrees. For example, data protection, competition, and consumer
protection authorities in the European Union have initiated
actions, investigations, or administrative orders seeking to
restrict the ways in which we collect and use information, or
impose sanctions, and other authorities may do the same.

Any such claims, suits, government investigations, and proceedings
are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with
certainty. Regardless of their outcomes, such legal or regulatory
proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal
costs, diversion of management and other personnel attention, and
other factors. In addition, it is possible that a resolution of one
or more such proceedings could result in substantial costs, civil
and criminal liability, penalties, or sanctions, as well as
judgments, consent decrees, or orders preventing us
                                63

Failure to protect or enforce our proprietary and intellectual

We regard our Advertising solutions and Apps and related source
code as proprietary and rely on a variety of methods, including a
combination of copyright, patent, trademark, and trade secret laws
and employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements, to protect
our proprietary rights. We view the protection of our trade
secrets, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, domain
names, patents, and other product rights as critical to our
success. We strive to protect our intellectual property rights by
relying on federal, state, and common law rights, as well as
contractual restrictions and business practices. We also enter into
confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our
employees and contractors and confidentiality agreements with
parties with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to,
and disclosure and use of, our proprietary information. However,
these contractual arrangements and business practices may not
prevent the misappropriation of our proprietary information or
deter independent development of similar technologies by others.

We own or license, and pursue the registration of, copyrights,
trademarks, service marks, domain names, and patents in the United
States and in certain locations outside the United States. This
process can be expensive and time-consuming, may not always be
successful depending on local laws or other circumstances, and we
also may choose not to pursue registrations in every location
depending on the nature of the project to which the intellectual
property rights pertain. We may, over time, increase our
investments in protecting our creative works.

We are aware that some unauthorized copying of our Apps occurs, and
if a significantly greater amount of unauthorized copying of our
Apps were to occur, it could adversely affect our business. In
addition, even if authorized copying of our Apps occurs, third-
party platforms may not remove infringing material. We also cannot
be certain that existing intellectual property laws will provide
adequate protection for our products in connection with emerging
technologies. For example, laws relating to intellectual property
ownership and license rights, including copyright, with respect to
AI and the use of tools containing AI have not been fully
interpreted by U.S. courts or been fully addressed by federal and
state regulations. As a result, our ability to fully protect our
products, technologies and solutions under current and future legal
regimes, especially as it relates to AI tools and technologies, may
be limited or impacted by future laws, regulations, interpretations
or other legislative or judicial actions. Litigation may be
necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our
trade secrets, or determine the validity and scope of proprietary
rights claimed by others. Any litigation of this nature, regardless
of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs, adverse
publicity, and diversion of management and technical resources. If
we fail to maintain, protect, and enhance our intellectual property
rights, our business, financial condition, and results of
operations could be adversely affected.

We are, and may in the future be, subject to intellectual property
disputes, which are costly to defend and could require us to pay
significant damages and could limit our ability to use certain
technologies in the future.

From time to time, we have faced, and we may face in the future,
allegations that we have infringed the trademarks, copyrights,
patents, and other intellectual property rights of third parties,
including from our competitors, non-practicing entities and former
employers of our personnel. Intellectual property litigation may be
protracted and expensive, and the results are difficult to predict.
As the result of any court judgment or settlement, we may be
obligated to alter our Advertising solutions or Apps, in a
particular geographic region or worldwide, pay royalties or
significant settlement costs, purchase licenses, or develop
substitutes.

In certain of our agreements, we also indemnify our licensees and
other business partners. We may incur significant expenses
defending these business partners if they are sued for intellectual
property infringement based on allegations related to our
technology. If a business partner were to lose a lawsuit and in
turn seek indemnification from us, we also could be subject to
significant monetary liabilities. In addition, because our
Advertising solutions and Apps often involve the use of third-party
technology, this increases our exposure to litigation in
circumstances where there is a claim of infringement asserted
against one of our mobile games or other products and services in
question, even if the claim does not pertain to our technology.
                                64

Many of our products and services contain open source software, and
we license some of our software through open source projects, which
may pose particular risks to our proprietary software, products,
and services in a manner that could adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.

We use open source software in our Advertising solutions and Apps
and expect to continue to use open source software in the future.
In addition, we contribute software source code to open source
projects under open source licenses or release internal software
projects under open source licenses, and anticipate continuing to
do so in the future. The terms of many open source licenses to
which we are subject have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign
courts, and there is a risk that open source software licenses
could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated
conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide or distribute
our products or services. Additionally, under some open source
licenses, if we combine our proprietary software with open source
software in a certain manner, third parties may claim ownership of,
a license to, or demand release of, the open source software or
derivative works that we developed using such software, which could
include our proprietary source code. Such third parties may also
seek to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license
through litigation which, if successful, could require us to make
our proprietary software source code freely available, purchase a
costly license, or cease offering the implicated products or
services unless and until we can re-engineer them to avoid
infringement. This re-engineering process could require significant
additional research and development resources, and we may not be
able to complete it successfully. In addition to risks related to
open source license requirements, use of certain open source
software may pose greater risks than use of third-party commercial
software, since open source licensors generally do not provide
warranties or controls on the origin of software and open source
software could incorporate AI generated code which may be a result
of hallucinatory behavior. Any of these risks could be difficult to
eliminate or manage, and, if not addressed, could adversely affect
our business, reputation, financial condition, and results of
operations.

Our ability to acquire and maintain licenses to intellectual
property may affect our business, financial condition, and results
of operations. Competition for these licenses may make them more
expensive and increase our costs.

While most of the intellectual property we use in our Advertising
solutions and Apps is created by us, from time to time, we also
acquire rights to third-party intellectual property. Proprietary
licenses may limit our use of intellectual property to specific
uses and for specific time periods, require time and attention of
licensors in providing guidance and related approvals, and include
other contractual obligations with which we must comply.
Additionally, competition for these licenses is intense and often
results in increased advances, minimum payment guarantees, and
royalties to the licensor, and as such we may be unable to identify
suitable licensing targets or complete licensing arrangements. If
we are unable to obtain and remain in compliance with the terms of
these licenses or obtain additional licenses on reasonable economic
terms, our business and results of operations could be adversely
affected. Further, if the mix of IAPs shifts toward mobile games in
which we use licensed intellectual property or if we develop
additional Apps that require licensing of third-party intellectual
property, our overall margins may be reduced due to royalty
obligations.

In addition, many of our Apps are built on proprietary source code
of third parties, such as Unity Software. Unity Software offers
certain solutions that may compete with our offerings. If we are
unable to renew licenses to proprietary source code underlying our
mobile games, or the terms and conditions of these licenses change
at the time of renewal, our business, financial condition, and
results of operations could be adversely affected. We rely on third
parties, including Unity Software, to maintain versions of their
proprietary engines that allow us to distribute our mobile games on
multiple platforms. If a third party from whom we license source
code discontinues support for one or more of these platforms, our
business, financial condition, and results of operations could be
adversely affected.
                                                                   
   Risks Related to Financial and Accounting Matters               
                                                                   
If we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls
and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to
produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with
applicable regulations could be impaired.

As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements
of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the rules and
regulations of the applicable Nasdaq listing standards. We expect
that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue
to increase our legal, accounting, and financial compliance costs,
make some activities more difficult, time-consuming and costly, and
place significant strain on our personnel, systems, and resources.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we
maintain effective disclosure controls and
                                65                                 
Table of C ontents
procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are
continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and other
procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed by us in the reports that we will file with the SEC is
recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time
periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that information
required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is
accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and
financial officers.

In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will
continue to expend, significant resources, including accounting-
related costs and significant management oversight. If any of these
new or improved controls and systems do not perform as expected, we
may experience deficiencies in our controls. The effectiveness of
our controls and procedures may also be limited by a variety of
factors including faulty human judgment and simple errors,
omissions or mistakes, fraudulent action of an individual or
collusion of two or more people, and inappropriate management
override of controls and procedures.

Our current controls and any new controls that we develop may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business.
Further, to the extent we acquire other businesses, the acquired
company may not have a sufficiently robust system of controls and
we may discover deficiencies. Any failure to develop or maintain
effective controls or any difficulties encountered in their
implementation or improvement could adversely affect our results of
operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations
and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for
prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective
internal control over financial reporting also could adversely
affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual
independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports
regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting that we are required to include in our periodic reports
that are filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and
procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also
cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and
other information, which would likely cause the market price of our
Class A common stock to decline. In addition, if we are unable to
continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain
listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. As a public company, we
are required to provide an annual management report on the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and
our independent registered public accounting firm is required to
formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting
firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not
satisfied with the level at which our internal control over
financial reporting is documented, designed, or operating. Any
failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal
control over financial reporting could adversely affect our
business, financial condition, and results of operations and could
cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.

We rely on assumptions and estimates to calculate certain of our
key metrics and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics
could adversely affect our reputation and our business.

Certain of the metrics that we disclose are calculated using
internal company data that has not been independently verified or
data from third-party attribution partners. While these metrics and
figures are based on what we believe to be reasonable calculations
for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent
challenges in measuring these metrics and figures across our
worldwide client base and user base. We regularly review and may
adjust our processes for calculating our metrics and other figures
to improve their accuracy, but these efforts may not prove
successful and we may discover material inaccuracies. In addition,
our methodology for calculating these metrics may be updated from
time to time and may differ from the methodology used by other
companies to calculate similar metrics and figures. We may also
discover unexpected errors in the data that we are using that
resulted from technical or other errors. If we determine that any
of our metrics or figures are not accurate, we may be required to
revise or cease reporting such metrics or figures. Any real or
perceived inaccuracies in our metrics and other figures could harm
our reputation and adversely affect our business.

We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if
our goodwill becomes impaired.

We are required under GAAP to review our goodwill for impairment at
least annually or more frequently when events or changes in
circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances,
indicating a requirement to reevaluate whether our goodwill
continues to be recoverable, include a significant decline in the
market price of our Class A common stock and our market
capitalization, slower growth rates in our industry,
underperformance of certain assets, or other materially adverse
events. We may be required to record a significant charge to
earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any
impairment of our goodwill is determined.
                                66                                 
Table of C ontents
We have a substantial amount of indebtedness and our obligations
thereunder may limit our operational flexibility or otherwise
adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.

As of March 31, 2025, we had a total of $3.6 billion in aggregate
principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding (the “Senior
Notes”). We also had $1.0 billion of commitments (with a $100
million letter of credit sublimit) under our senior unsecured
credit agreement that provides for an unsecured revolving credit
facility (the “Credit Agreement”). As of March 31, 2025, we had
$200.0 million in outstanding borrowings under the Credit
Agreement. We repaid $100.0 million of the outstanding borrowings
in April 2025 and the remaining $100.0 million in May 2025.

Our indebtedness could adversely impact us. For example, these
obligations could among other things:

• require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow
from operations to service and repay the indebtedness, reducing the
amount of cash flow available for other purposes;

• make it difficult for us to pay other obligations;

• increase our cost of borrowing;

• make it difficult to obtain favorable terms for any necessary
future financing for working capital, capital expenditures,
strategic acquisitions and partnerships, debt service requirements,
or other purposes;

• restrict us from making strategic acquisitions and partnerships
or cause us to make divestitures or similar transactions;

• adversely affect our liquidity and result in a material adverse
effect on our financial condition upon repayment of the
indebtedness;

• increase our vulnerability to adverse and economic and industry
conditions;

• increase our exposure to interest rate risk from variable rate
indebtedness;

• place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less
leveraged competitors; and

• limit our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in
our business.

In addition, from time to time we have entered into interest rate
swap instruments to limit our exposure to changes in variable
interest rates. While our hedging strategy is designed to minimize
the impact of increases in interest rates applicable to our
variable rate debt, including our credit facility, there can be no
guarantee that our hedging strategy will be effective, and we may
experience credit-related losses in some circumstances. Upon the
occurrence of a change of control repurchase event (as defined in
the indenture governing the Senior Notes), we will be required to
repurchase the Senior Notes at the option of each holder. We may
not have sufficient funds to repurchase the Senior Notes in cash at
the time of any change of control repurchase event. Upon the
occurrence of a change of control (as defined in the Credit
Agreement), the lenders thereunder could accelerate the obligations
under the Credit Agreement and terminate the commitments under the
Credit Agreement. The indentures governing the Senior Notes also
include customary affirmative and negative covenants (including
covenants restricting our ability to incur certain liens and enter
into sale and leaseback transactions, subject to certain
exceptions), events of default, and other customary provisions. The
Credit Agreement also imposes restrictions on us and requires us to
maintain compliance with specified covenants regardless of whether
any amounts are outstanding thereunder. Our ability to comply with
these covenants may be affected by market, economic, financial,
competitive, legislative, and regulatory factors, as well as other
factors that are beyond our control. A breach of any of the
covenants in the indentures governing the Senior Notes or the
Credit Agreement could result in an event of default, which, if not
cured or waived, could trigger acceleration of our indebtedness and
an increase in the interest rates applicable to such indebtedness
(in the case of the Credit Agreement), and may result in the
acceleration of or default under any other debt we may incur in the
future to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision
applies. The acceleration of the indebtedness under the Credit
Agreement, the Senior Notes, or under any other indebtedness could
have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, and results of operations.

We receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in
the United States. Factors that may impact our credit ratings
include debt levels, planned asset purchases or sales and near-term
and long-term growth opportunities. Liquidity, asset quality and
cost structure could also be considered by the rating agencies. The
applicable margins with respect to the loans incurred under the
Credit Agreement will vary based on our applicable public debt
credit ratings assigned by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.,
Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC, Fitch’s and any successor
to each such rating agency business. Moreover, our Senior Notes are
currently rated investment-grade by various rating agencies. A
ratings downgrade, including any announcement that our ratings are
                                67                                 
Table of C ontents
under further review for a downgrade, could adversely impact our
ability to access debt markets in the future and increase the cost
of current or future debt and may adversely affect our share price.

We may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our
significant debt service obligations, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations, and cash flows.

Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt
obligations depends on our financial condition and results of
operations, which are subject to prevailing economic and
competitive conditions and to certain financial, business,
legislative, regulatory, and other factors beyond our control. We
may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating
activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium,
if any, or interest on our indebtedness. If our cash flows and
capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service
obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay strategic
acquisitions and partnerships, capital expenditures, and payments
on account of other obligations, seek additional capital,
restructure or refinance our indebtedness, or sell assets. These
alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to
meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our ability to
restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of
the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any
refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and could
require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could
further restrict our business operations. In addition, we cannot
assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our
indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.

If we are unable to repay or otherwise refinance our indebtedness
when due, or if any other event of default is not cured or waived,
the applicable lenders or holders could accelerate our outstanding
obligations, which could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation.
In the event the applicable lenders or holders accelerate the
repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have
sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. Any acceleration of
amounts due under the agreements governing our indebtedness could
have a material and adverse effect on our business.

We may require additional capital to meet our financial obligations
and support business growth, and this capital may not be available
on acceptable terms or at all.

We intend to continue to make significant investments to support
our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to
business challenges, including the need to continue to develop our
Advertising solutions, enhance our existing Apps and develop new
Apps and features, improve our operating infrastructure, or enter
into new markets or strategic acquisitions and partnerships.
Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity, equity-linked, or
debt financings to secure additional funds. Our ability to obtain
additional financing that we may choose or need, including for the
refinancing of future debt maturities or potential strategic
acquisitions and investments, will depend on, among other things,
our development efforts, business plans, operating performance, and
the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing.
Also, if we raise additional funds through future issuances of
equity or equity-linked securities, our existing stockholders could
experience significant dilution, and any new equity securities we
issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to
those of holders of our Class A common stock. Any debt financing
that we secure in the future could involve offering security
interests and undertaking restrictive covenants relating to our
capital raising activities and other financial and operational
matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain
additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including
potential acquisitions. Our Credit Agreement, which provides for a
revolving credit facility, contains a financial covenant with which
we must comply. We may not be able to obtain additional financing
on terms favorable to us, if at all. Additionally, if we seek to
access additional capital or increase our borrowing, there can be
no assurance that financing and credit may be available on
favorable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate
financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require
it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to
respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired, and
our business, financial condition, or results of operations could
be adversely affected.
Risks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock and
Governance
The multi-class structure of our common stock and the Voting
Agreement among the Voting Agreement Parties have the effect of
concentrating voting power with the Voting Agreement Parties, which
will limit your ability to influence the outcome of matters
submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election
of our board of directors, the adoption of amendments to our
certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and the approval of any
merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our
assets, or other major corporate transactions.

We have three classes of common stock. Our Class A common stock has
one vote per share, our Class B
                                68                                 
Table of C ontents
common stock has 20 votes per share, and our Class C common stock
has no voting rights, except as otherwise required by law. Adam
Foroughi, our co-founder, CEO, and Chairperson and Herald Chen, a
member of our board of directors (collectively with certain
affiliates, the "Voting Agreement Parties") together hold all of
the issued and outstanding shares of our Class B common stock. As
of March 31, 2025, the Voting Agreement Parties collectively held
approximately 68% of the voting power of our outstanding capital
stock in the aggregate. This voting power includes shares of Class
A common stock deemed beneficially owned in accordance with Rule
13d-3(d)(1) under the Exchange Act. The Voting Agreement Parties
have entered into a voting agreement (the "Voting Agreement")
whereby all Class B common stock held by the Voting Agreement
Parties and their respective permitted entities and permitted
transferees will be voted as determined by Mr. Foroughi and Mr.
Chen. As a result, the Voting Agreement Parties will collectively
be able to determine or significantly influence any action
requiring the approval of our stockholders, including the election
of our board of directors, the adoption of amendments to our
certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and the approval of any
merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our
assets, or other major corporate transaction. The Voting Agreement
Parties may have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a
way with which you disagree, and which may be adverse to your
interests. This concentrated control may have the effect of
delaying, preventing, or deterring a change in control of our
company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to
receive a premium for their capital stock as part of a sale of our
company, and might ultimately affect the market price of our Class
A common stock.

Future transfers by the holders of Class B common stock will
generally result in those shares automatically converting into
shares of Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such
as certain transfers effected for estate planning, or other
transfers among the Voting Agreement Parties. In addition, each
share of Class B common stock will convert automatically into one
share of Class A common stock upon certain events specified in our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation.

In addition, because our Class C common stock carries no voting
rights (except as otherwise required by law), if we issue Class C
common stock in the future, the holders of Class B common stock may
be able to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome
of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders for a
longer period of time than would be the case if we issued Class A
common stock rather than Class C common stock in such transactions.

We are considered a “controlled company” within the meaning of the
Nasdaq corporate governance requirements, and, as a result, we
qualify for exemptions from certain corporate governance
requirements.

As a result of our multi-class common stock structure and the
Voting Agreement among the Voting Agreement Parties, the Voting
Agreement Parties collectively hold greater than a majority of the
voting power of our outstanding capital stock and the Voting
Agreement Parties have the authority to vote the shares of all
Class B common stock, subject to the terms of the Voting Agreement,
at their discretion on all matters to be voted upon by
stockholders. Therefore, we are considered a “controlled company”
as that term is set forth in the Nasdaq corporate governance
requirements. Under these corporate governance requirements, a
company in which over 50% of the voting power for the election of
directors is held by an individual, a group, or another company is
a “controlled company” and may elect not to comply with certain
corporate governance requirements, including:

• the requirement that a majority of its board of directors consist
of independent directors;

• the requirement that we have a nominating/corporate governance
committee that is comprised entirely of independent directors with
a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and
responsibilities;

• the requirement that we have a compensation committee that is
comprised entirely of independent directors with a written charter
addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities; and

• the requirement for an annual performance evaluation of the
nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees.

We do not currently avail ourselves of any of these corporate
governance accommodations, though we may do so in the future. In
the event that we cease to be a “controlled company” and our Class
A common stock continues to be listed on Nasdaq, we will be
required to comply with these provisions within the applicable
transition periods.

The market price of our Class A common stock could be volatile, and
you could lose all or part of your investment.

The market price of our Class A common stock has, and may continue
to, fluctuate substantially depending on a number of factors,
including those described in this “Risk Factors” section, many of
which are beyond our control and may not be related to our
operating performance. These fluctuations could cause you to lose
all or part of your

Table of C ontents
investment in our Class A common stock. Factors that have in the
past caused and could in the future cause fluctuations in the
market price of our Class A common stock include the following:

• price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from
time to time, including fluctuations due to general economic
uncertainty or negative market sentiment;

• volatility in the market and trading volumes of technology
stocks;

• our indication of interest to explore a purchase of TikTok in all
markets outside of China, including public perceptions regarding
our proposal and the likelihood that we will enter into a
definitive agreement to acquire TikTok in all markets outside of
China;

• changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of
other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in
particular;

• sales of shares of our Class A common stock by us or our
stockholders;

• rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in
our industry;

• failure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us,
changes in financial estimates by securities analysts who follow
our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the
expectations of investors;

• actual or perceived significant data breaches involving our
Advertising solutions or Apps;

• the financial or non-financial metric projections we may provide
to the public, any changes in those projections or our failure to
meet those projections;

• third-party data published about us or other advertising or
mobile gaming companies, whether or not such data accurately
reflects circumstances;

• announcements by us or our competitors of new products or
services;

• the public’s reaction to our press releases, other public
announcements, and filings with the SEC;

• fluctuations in the trading volume of shares of our Class A
common stock or the size of our public float;

• short selling of our Class A common stock or related derivative
securities, and the publication of short seller reports;

• actual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our results of
operations;

• actual or anticipated developments in our business, our
competitors’ businesses, or the competitive landscape generally;

• our issuance or repurchase of shares of our Class A common stock;

• litigation or regulatory action involving us, our industry or
both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those
of our competitors;

• developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or
other proprietary rights;

• announced or completed acquisitions of businesses or technologies
by us or our competitors;

• new laws, regulations or app store policies or new
interpretations of existing laws, regulations or app store policies
applicable to our business;

• changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines,
interpretations, or principles;

• major catastrophic events in our domestic and foreign markets;

• any significant change in our management; and

• general economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our
markets.

In addition, the market price of our Class A common stock has in
the past fluctuated and could in the future fluctuate for reasons
unrelated to our business, financial condition, or results of
operations, including if the market for technology stocks or the
stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence.
The market price of our Class A common stock might also decline in
reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even
if these events do not directly affect us. Accordingly, we cannot
assure you of the liquidity of any trading market, your ability to
sell your shares of our Class A common stock when desired, or the
prices that you may obtain for your

In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of
a company’s securities, securities class action litigation has
often been brought against that company. If the market price of our
Class A common stock is volatile, we may become the target of
securities litigation. Securities litigation could result in
substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and
resources from our business. Such litigation could adversely affect
our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We may not realize the anticipated long-term stockholder value of
our share repurchase programs and any failure to repurchase our
Class A common stock after we have announced our intention to do so
may negatively impact our stock price.

In October 2024, our board of directors authorized an increase to
our share repurchase program of up to $2.0 billion, which
additional amount may be repurchased from time to time subject to a
limitation in any fiscal quarter of the amount of our Free Cash
Flow in the preceding fiscal quarter and compliance with applicable
law and any contractual restrictions. In February 2025, our board
of directors modified our share repurchase program such that $500
million was immediately available for repurchase of shares of our
Class A common stock, notwithstanding the amount that otherwise
would have remained available during the quarter under the prior
program limitation, and such limit shall be increased in future
quarters by the amount of free cash flow generated in the preceding
fiscal quarter, with such increases to be carried forward and
remain available for future repurchases if not used (up to the
total authorized amount available for repurchases). As of March 31,
2025, $1.3 billion was available for repurchase of our Class A
common stock under our share repurchase program. Under this or any
other future share repurchase programs, we may make share
repurchases through a variety of methods, including open share
market purchases, block transactions or privately negotiated
transactions, in accordance with applicable federal securities
laws. Our share repurchase program has no time limit, does not
obligate us to repurchase any specific number of shares and may be
suspended at any time at our discretion and without prior notice.
The timing and amount of any repurchases, if any, will be subject
to liquidity, stock price, market and economic conditions,
compliance with applicable legal requirements such as Delaware
surplus and solvency tests, compliance with our credit agreement,
and other relevant factors. Any failure to repurchase stock after
we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our
reputation and investor confidence in us and may negatively impact
our stock price.

The existence of this share repurchase program could cause our
stock price to be higher than it otherwise would be and could
potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. Although
this program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value,
there is no assurance it will do so because the market price of our
Class A common stock may decline below the levels at which we
repurchased shares and short-term stock price fluctuations could
reduce the effectiveness of the program.

Repurchasing our Class A common stock will reduce the amount of
cash we have available to fund working capital, capital
expenditures, strategic acquisitions or business opportunities, and
other general corporate requirements, and we may fail to realize
the anticipated long-term stockholder value of any share repurchase
programs.

The issuance of additional stock in connection with financings,
acquisitions, investments, our equity incentive plans, or otherwise
will dilute all other stockholders.

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us
to issue up to 1,500,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, up to
150,000,000 shares of Class C common stock, and up to 100,000,000
shares of preferred stock with such rights and preferences as may
be determined by our board of directors. Subject to compliance with
applicable rules and regulations, we may issue shares of Class A
common stock or securities convertible into shares of our Class A
common stock from time to time in connection with a financing,
acquisition, investment, our equity incentive plans, or otherwise.
For example, in connection with our acquisition of Adjust in April
2021, we issued convertible securities that converted into an
aggregate of 6,320,688 shares of our Class A common stock and a
purchase of TikTok in all markets outside of China, if it were to
take place, would likely require us to issue a significant amount
of equity. Any such issuance could result in dilution to our
existing stockholders and/or negatively impact the market price of
our Class A common stock.

Our multi-class stock structure, the Voting Agreement, and other
provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
and amended and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer,
or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the market price of
our Class A common stock.

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended
and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the
acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:

• our multi-class common stock structure and the Voting Agreement,
which provide the Voting Agreement Parties with the ability to
determine or significantly influence the outcome of matters
requiring stockholder approval, even if they own significantly less
than a majority of the shares of our outstanding common stock;

• vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by our
board of directors and not by stockholders;

• a special meeting of our stockholders may only be called by a
majority of our board of directors, the chairperson of our board of
directors, our Chief Executive Officer, or our President;

• advance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate
candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an
annual meeting of stockholders;

• our amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not
provide for cumulative voting;

• our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes
undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established
and shares of which may be issued by our board of directors,
without further action by our stockholders;

• after the first date on which the outstanding shares of our Class
B common stock represent less than a majority of the total combined
voting power of our Class A common stock and our Class B common
stock (the "Voting Threshold Date"), our stockholders will only be
able to take action at a meeting of stockholders and will not be
able to take action by written consent for any matter; and

• certain litigation against us may only be brought in Delaware.

These provisions, alone or together, could discourage, delay, or
prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company.
These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it
more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their
choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they
desire, any of which, under certain circumstances, could limit the
opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their
shares of our Class A common stock, and could also affect the
market price of our Class A common stock.

Our amended and restated bylaws designate a state or federal court
located within the State of Delaware and the federal district
courts of the United States as the exclusive forum for
substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which
could limit our stockholders’ ability to choose the judicial forum
for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.

Our amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent in
writing to the selection of an alternative forum, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any
derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any
action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any
of our directors, officers, or other employees to us or our
stockholders, (iii) any action arising pursuant to any provision of
the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws,
or (iv) any other action asserting a claim that is governed by the
internal affairs doctrine shall be the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have
jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of
Delaware), in all cases subject to the court having jurisdiction
over indispensable parties named as defendants, and provided that
this exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to
enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act.

Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction
for federal and state courts over all such Securities Act actions.
Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to
entertain such claims. To prevent having to litigate claims in
multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary
rulings by different courts, among other considerations, our
amended and restated bylaws also provide that the federal district
courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum
for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising
under the Securities Act. However, while the Delaware Supreme Court
ruled in March 2020 that federal forum selection provisions
purporting to require claims under the Securities Act be brought in
federal court are “facially valid” under Delaware law, there is
uncertainty as to whether other courts will enforce our federal
forum provision. If the federal forum provision is found to be
unenforceable, we may incur additional costs associated with
resolving such matters.
                                72                                 
Table of C ontents
Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding
or owning (or continuing to hold or own) any interest in any of our
securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the
foregoing bylaw provisions. Although we believe these exclusive
forum provisions benefit us by providing increased consistency in
the application of Delaware law and federal securities laws in the
types of lawsuits to which each applies, the exclusive forum
provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a
judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or any of our
directors, officers, stockholders, or other employees, which may
discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims against us and our
current and former directors, officers, stockholders, or other
employees. Our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our
compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and
regulations thereunder as a result of our exclusive forum
provisions. Further, in the event a court finds either exclusive
forum provision contained in our amended and restated bylaws to be
unenforceable or inapplicable in an action, we may incur additional
costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions,
which could harm our results of operations.

During the three months ended March 31, 2025, we issued 16,245
shares of our Class A common stock upon the vesting and settlement
of RSUs issued under our 2021 Partner Studio Incentive Plan.

The foregoing transactions did not involve any underwriters, any
underwriting discounts or commissions, or any public offering. We
believe the offer, sale, and issuance of the above securities was
exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the “Act”) by virtue of Section 4(a)(2) of the Act and
Regulation S promulgated under the Act, because the issuance of
securities to the recipients did not involve a public offering. The
recipients of the securities in the transaction represented their
intentions to acquire the securities for investment only and not
with a view to or for sale in connection with any distribution
thereof, and appropriate legends were placed upon the stock
certificates issued in the transaction. All recipients had adequate
access, through their relationships with us or otherwise, to
information about us. The issuance of these securities was made
without any general solicitation or advertising.

(1) In February 2022, our board of directors authorized a
repurchase program of up to $750.0 million of our Class A common
stock. In 2023, our board of directors authorized increases to the
repurchase program of $743.6 million. In 2024, our board of
directors authorized increases to the repurchase program of an
aggregate amount of $3.3 billion. In February 2025, our board of
directors modified our repurchase program such that $500 million
was immediately available for repurchase of shares of our Class A
common stock, notwithstanding the amount that otherwise would have
remained available during the quarter under the prior program
limitation, and such limit shall be increased in future quarters by
the amount of free cash flow generated in the preceding fiscal
quarter, with such increases to be carried forward and remain
available for future repurchases if not used (up to the total
authorized amount available for repurchases). Repurchases may be
made from time to time through open market purchases or through
privately negotiated transactions, subject to market conditions,
applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. Open
market repurchases may be structured to occur in accordance with
the requirements of Rule 10b-18. We may also, from time to time,
enter into Rule 10b-5 trading plans to facilitate repurchases of
shares. The repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any
particular amount of our Class A common stock, has no expiration
date and may be modified, suspended, or terminated at any time at
our discretion. See Note 6 - Equity of the Notes to Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item I of this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information related to
share repurchases.

associated with the repurchases under our repurchase program.
