statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, which

“intend,” “target,” “project,” “contemplate,” “believe,”
“estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” or “continue” or the negative

We caution you that the foregoing list may not contain all of the
forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q.

You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions
of future events. We have based the forward-looking statements
contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q primarily on our
current expectations and projections about future events and trends
that we believe may affect our business, financial condition,
results of operations, and prospects. The outcome of the events
described in these forward-looking statements is subject to risks,
uncertainties, and other factors, including those described in the
section titled “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and
rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge
from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all
risks and
                                 1

uncertainties that could have an impact on the forward-looking
statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We
cannot assure you that the results, events, and circumstances
reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or
occur, and actual results, events, or circumstances could differ
materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.

Neither we nor any other person assumes responsibility for the
accuracy and completeness of any of these forward-looking
statements. Moreover, the forward-looking statements made in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q relate only to events as of the date
on which the statements are made. We undertake no obligation to
update any forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q to reflect events or circumstances after the date of
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or to reflect new information or
the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law.
We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions, or expectations
disclosed in our forward-looking statements and you should not
place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Our
forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of
any future acquisitions, partnerships, mergers, dispositions, joint
ventures, or investments we may make.

In addition, statements that “we believe” and similar statements
reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These
statements are based upon information available to us as of the
date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and while we believe
such information forms a reasonable basis for such statements, such
information may be limited or incomplete, and our statements should
not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive
inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant
information. These statements are inherently uncertain and
investors are cautioned not to unduly rely upon these statements.

1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies

Description of Business
AppLovin Corporation (the “Company” or “AppLovin”) was incorporated
in the state of Delaware on July 18, 2011. The Company is a leader
in the advertising industry providing end-to-end advertising
solutions that allow businesses to reach, monetize and grow their
global audiences.

The Company is headquartered in Palo Alto, California, and has
several operating locations in the U.S. as well as various
international office locations in North America, Asia, and Europe.
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for
interim financial reporting. Certain information and footnote
disclosures normally included in the financial statements prepared
in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to
such rules and regulations. Therefore, the unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes
included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the
SEC on February 27, 2025. The condensed consolidated balance sheet
data as of December 31, 2024 was derived from the audited
consolidated financial statements at that date but does not include
all disclosures required by GAAP. The accompanying unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all normal and
recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management,
necessary for the fair presentation of the Company’s financial
position, results of operations, cash flows and stockholders’
equity for the interim periods presented. The results of operations
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 shown in
this report are not necessarily indicative of the results to be
expected for the full year ending December 31, 2025 or any other
period.
Amounts presented may not sum due to rounding. Certain prior period
amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period
presentation where applicable.
Basis of Consolidation
The Company's condensed consolidated financial statements include
accounts and operations of the Company and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries. In accordance with the provisions of Accounting
Standards Codification ("ASC") 810, Consolidation , the Company is
also required to consolidate any variable interest entities ("VIE")
when it is the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary has
both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most
significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and the
obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be
significant to the VIE, or the right to receive benefits from the
VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The Company
evaluates its relationships with all VIEs on an ongoing basis. All
intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon
consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the Company's condensed consolidated financial
statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and
disclosed in the condensed consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes. The Company bases its estimates on assumptions
that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an
ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including, but
not limited to, those related to fair values of assets and
liabilities acquired through acquisitions, useful lives of
intangible assets and property and equipment, income and indirect
taxes, contingent liabilities, evaluation of recoverability of
intangible assets and long-lived assets, goodwill impairment,
stock-based compensation, fair value of financial instruments.
These estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actual
results could differ materially from those estimates.
Apps Business Divestiture
On May 7, 2025, the Company and its subsidiaries Morocco, Inc. and
AppLovin GmbH entered into a purchase agreement with Tripledot and
its subsidiaries Eton Games Inc. and Tripledot Group Holdings
Limited to sell the equity interests of certain wholly-owned
subsidiaries that operate the Company’s Apps business (the “Apps
Business”). The sale was completed on June 30, 2025. The Company
determined that the divestiture of the Apps
                                10                                 
Table of Contents
Business met the criteria for presentation as discontinued
operations in the second quarter of the year ending December 31,
2025, as it represented a strategic shift that had a major impact
on the Company’s operations and financial results. Accordingly, the
results of the Apps Business, including the gain on divestiture,
are reported as discontinued operations in the condensed
consolidated statements of operations, and as such, have been
excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for
all periods presented. Further, the assets and liabilities of the
Apps Business have been reclassified as assets and liabilities of
discontinued operations in the condensed consolidated balance
sheets as of December 31, 2024. The condensed consolidated
statements of cash flows continue to be presented on a consolidated
basis for both continuing and discontinued operations. Certain
costs previously allocated to the Apps Business for segment
reporting purposes do not meet the criteria for classification
within discontinued operations, and as such, these costs have been
reallocated to continuing operations. In addition, historical
intercompany balances and transactions between the Company and the
divested Apps Business that were previously eliminated in
consolidation have been excluded from both continuing and
discontinued operations. Unless otherwise indicated, all references
in the Notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements
relate to continuing operations.See Note 2 – Discontinued
Operations for further details.
Segment Reporting
Following the divestiture of the Apps Business, the Company has
determined that it currently operates as a single operating and
reportable segment at the consolidated level. Prior period segment
results and related disclosures have been recast to conform to the
current period segment presentation.See Note 12 – Segment for
further details.
Equity Method Investments
The Company accounts for investments using the equity method of
accounting when it has significant influence over the financial and
operating policies, but not control, of the investee. The equity
method investments are initially recorded at cost and included in
other non-current assets in the condensed consolidated balance
sheet. The Company records its share of investee's net income or
loss and the amortization of equity method basis difference,
calculated as the difference between the investment and the amount
of underlying equity in net assets acquired one-quarter in arrears,
which is applied consistently from period to period. The Company
records its share of investee's net income or loss and the
amortization of equity method basis difference in income (loss)
from equity method investment, net of tax, in the condensed
consolidated statement of operations. The Company monitors on an
ongoing basis its equity method investments for indicators of
other-than-temporary declines in fair value below carrying value,
and records any required impairment loss in income (loss) from
equity method investment, net of tax, in the condensed consolidated
statement of operations.See Note 5 – Equity Method Investments for
further details.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements (Issued Not Yet Adopted)
In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the
"FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2023-09, Income
Taxes: Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures , which requires
disaggregation of rate reconciliation categories and income taxes
paid by jurisdiction. The amendments will be effective for annual
periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The amendments may be
applied prospectively or retrospectively, and early adoption is
permitted. The Company is currently evaluating this ASU to
determine its impact on the Company's disclosures.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement:
Reporting Comprehensive Income-Expense Disaggregation Disclosures ,
which requires disaggregated disclosures, in the notes to the
financial statements, of certain categories of expenses that are
included in expense line items on the face of the income statement.
The amendments will be effective for annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2026, and interim periods beginning after December 15,
2027. The amendments may be applied prospectively or
retrospectively, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is
currently evaluating this ASU to determine its impact on the
Company's disclosures.
In September 2025, the FASB issued ASU 2025-06,

Divestiture

On June 30, 2025, the Company completed the sale of its Apps
Business, as part of its strategic effort to divest non-core assets
and dedicate its resources to advancing its advertising business.
In connection with the transaction, the Company received $
715.6million in total consideration, consisting of $ 430.6million
in cash and 596.9million ordinary shares of Tripledot, valued a t $
285.0million . These shares represented approximately 22% of
Tripledot’s outstanding ordinary shares and 20% of its fully
diluted equity capitalization as of the closing date. The cash
consideration of $ 430.6million includes $ 400.0million as
specified in the purchase agreement and $ 30.6million in
preliminary purchase price adjustments based on estimated closing
date net assets, which is subject to finalization in accordance
with the terms of the purchase agreement.

The fair value of the equity consideration was determined based on
the combined value of Tripledot and the Apps Business as of the
closing date, estimated using a combination of the market approach,
which incorporated valuation multiples of comparable public
companies, and the income approach based on projected discounted
cash flows. The significant assumptions used included estimates of
future revenues and operating expenses, long-term growth rates,
working capital requirements and discount rates, which are
considered unobservable inputs and are classified as Level 3 within
the fair value hierarchy. See Note 5 – Equity Method Investments
for further details.

For tax purposes, the transfer of certain Apps Business
subsidiaries was treated as an asset sale and resulted in a write-
off of $ 125.6million of deferred tax assets from the carrying
value of Apps Business net assets, which was included in the
provision for income taxes from discontinued operations. As a
result of the divestiture, the Company derecognized net assets of $
591.2million and incurred transaction costs of $ 18.3million,
resulting in a pre-tax gain of $ 106.2million, which was recorded
in net income from discontinued operations for the nine months
ended September 30, 2025.

In addition, the Company entered into a Transition Services
Agreement (“TSA”) with Tripledot. Under the terms of the TSA, the
Company agreed to provide limited administrative and transitional
services related to the divested Apps Business for a period of up
to six months following the closing date.

Goodwill Impairment

The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit
level on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes
in circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired.

On February 12, 2025, the Company entered into a non-binding term
sheet to sell its Apps Business to Tripledot. As of March 31, 2025,
the Apps Business was not classified as held for sale, as the
criteria required for such classification had not yet been met.
However, the Company identified the non-binding term sheet combined
with negotiations throughout the first quarter of 2025 to sell the
Apps Business as an indicator of impairment for the Apps reporting
unit and performed an interim quantitative goodwill impairment test
as of March 31, 2025. Based on this assessment, the Company
determined that the carrying amount of the Apps reporting unit
exceeded its estimated fair value and recorded a non-cash goodwill
impairment charge of $ 188.9million. This charge was included in
loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, for the
nine months ended September 30, 2025.

At the time the interim impairment test was performed, the Company
had not yet determined the fair value of the total consideration,
which was subject to the valuation of the equity consideration at
the closing of the transaction. As a result, the Company estimated
the fair value of the Apps reporting unit using the discounted cash
flow method of the income approach. Key valuation inputs included
projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates and long-
term growth rates, which are based on management’s estimates and
assumptions believed to be reasonable and reflective of known
market conditions as of the interim impairment test date. The
resulting fair value measurement is classified as Level 3 within

Revenue from Contracts with Customers
The Company generates revenue primarily from advertisers who use
the Axon Platform, which consists of Axon Advertising and MAX. The
platform provides the technology to match advertisers and owners of
digital advertising inventory (“Publishers”) via auctions at large
scale and microsecond-level speeds. The Company’s terms and
conditions generally stipulate payment terms of 30 days subsequent
to the end of the month. Substantially all of the Company's
contracts with customers are fully cancelable at any time or upon a
short notice.
The Company’s performance obligation is to provide customers with
access to the advertising solutions, which facilitates the
advertiser’s purchase of ad inventory from Publishers. The Company
does not control the ad inventory prior to its transfer to the
advertiser, because the Company does not have the substantive
ability to direct the use of nor obtain substantially all of the
remaining benefits from the ad inventory. The Company is not
primarily responsible for fulfillment. The Company is an agent as
it relates to the sale of third-party advertising inventory and
presents revenue on a net basis. The transaction price is the
product of either the number of completions of agreed upon actions
or advertisements displayed and the contractually agreed upon price
per advertising unit with the advertiser less consideration paid or
payable to Publishers. The Company recognizes revenue when the
agreed upon action is completed or when the ad is displayed to
users. The number of advertisements delivered and completions of
agreed upon actions is determined at the end of each month, which
resolves any uncertainty in the transaction price during the
reporting period.
The Company also generates revenue from Adjust's measurement and
analytics marketing platform that is recognized ratably over the
subscription period of generally up to twelve months. Revenue from
other services was not material.
The Company presents taxes collected from customers and remitted to
governmental authorities on a net basis.
Disaggregation of Revenue

Contract Balances
Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue related to Adjust,
which are recorded for payments received in advance of the
satisfaction of performance obligations. During the three months
ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, the Company recognized $
9.3million and $ 7.4million of revenue that was included in
deferred revenue as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, the Company
recognized $ 38.3million and $ 30.6million of revenue that was
included in deferred revenue as of December 31, 2024 and 2023,
respectively.
Unsatisfied Performance Obligations
Substantially all of the Company’s unsatisfied performance
obligations relate to contracts with an original expected length of
one year or less.

Financial Instruments Measured at Fair Value by Level on a
Recurring Basis

As of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the Company held $
352.8million and $ 41.5million in money market deposit accounts,
and $ 50.1million and an immaterialamount in money market funds,
respectively, which were included in cash and cash equivalents and
classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy.
Non-Marketable Equity Securities Measured at Net Asset Value
The Company held equity interests in certain private equity funds o
f $ 107.6million and $ 77.3million as of September 30, 2025 and
December 31, 2024, respectively, which are measured using the net
asset value practical

expedient. Under the net asset value practical expedient, the
Company records investments based on the proportionate share of the
underlying funds’ net asset value as of the Company's reporting
date. These investments are included in other non-current assets in
the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets.

These funds vary in investment strategies and generally have an
initial term of 7to 10years, which may be extended for 2to
3additional years with the applicable approval. These investments
are subject to certain restrictions regarding transfers and
withdrawals and generally cannot be redeemed. Distributions from
the funds will be received as the underlying investments are
liquidated. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss is limited to
the carrying value of these investments of $ 107.6million and
unfunded commitments of $ 3.0million as of September 30, 2025.

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, the
Company made total capital contributions of niland $ 18.7million,
respectively, related to these investments. Unrealized gains
related to these investments were $ 7.0million and $ 9.6million for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively,
and were notmaterial for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024.

Non-Marketable Equity Securities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-
Recurring Basis

The Company's non-marketable equity securities are investments in
privately held companies without readily determinable fair values.
The Company elected the measurement alternative to account for
these investments. Under the measurement alternative, the carrying
value of the non-marketable equity securities are adjusted based on
price changes from observable transactions of identical or similar
securities of the same issuer or for impairment. Any changes in
carrying value are recorded within other income (expense), net in
the Company's condensed consolidated statement of operations.

As of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the carrying
amounts of the Company's non-marketable equity securities were $
19.6million and $ 68.1million, respectively, and were included in
other non-current assets in the Company’s condensed consolidated
balance sheets. During the nine months ended September 30, 2025,
the Company recorded a $ 50.0million impairment on its investment
in Humans, Inc. Since acquisition, the Company recorded a
cumulative impairment charge of $ 78.0million related to these
investments.
                                                                   
  5. Equity Method Investments                                     
                                                                   
As disclosed in Note 2 – Discontinued Operations, the Company
received 596.9million ordinary shares of Tripledot, valued at $
285.0million, as part of the consideration for the sale of its Apps
Business. These shares represented approximately 22% of Tripledot’s
outstanding ordinary shares and the same proportion of its voting
rights as of the closing date. The Company determined it had the
ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over
Tripledot through its ownership interest. As such, the investment
was accounted for under the equity method of accounting and
included in other non-current assets on the condensed consolidated
balance sheets as of September 30, 2025.

The carrying value of the equity method investment will be adjusted
for the Company’s proportionate share of Tripledot’s income or
loss, recognized one quarter in arrears. The basis difference
between the investment's initial fair value and the Company's
proportional share of Tripledot’s net assets at closing was not
material. No income or loss from Tripledot was recorded in the
Company’s condensed consolidated statements of operations for the
three months ended September 30, 2025, as the transaction closed on
June 30, 2025.

Commitments

As of September 30, 2025, the Company's non-cancelable minimum
purchase commitments were primarily related to a multi-year
contractual arrangement with a cloud services provider. In August
2024, the Company amended its agreement with the provider,
committing to spending a minimum of $ 1.3billion over a three-
yearperiod. By September 30, 2025, the Company had made cumulative
payments of $ 485.1million towards this commitment.

Contingencies

From time to time, the Company may have certain contingent
liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of business
activities. The Company accrues a liability for such matters when
it is probable that future expenditures will be made, and such
expenditures can be reasonably estimated.

Legal Proceedings

The Company is involved from time to time in litigation, claims,
and proceedings. The outcomes of the Company’s legal proceedings
are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant
uncertainty, and could, either individually or in aggregate, have a
material adverse effect.

The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has
been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If it is
determined that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range
of loss can be estimated, the reasonably possible loss is
disclosed. The Company evaluates developments in legal matters that
could affect the amount of liability that has been previously
accrued, and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and
makes adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required
to determine the likelihood of matters and the estimated amount of
a loss related to such matters. To date, losses in connection with
legal proceedings have not been material.

The Company expenses legal fees in the period in which they are
incurred.
Indemnifications
The Company enters into indemnification provisions under agreements
with other parties in the ordinary course of business, including
certain customers, business partners, investors, contractors and
the Company’s officers, directors and certain employees. It is not
possible to determine the maximum potential loss under these
indemnification provisions due to the Company’s limited history of
prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances
involved in each particular provision. To date, losses recorded in
the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of operations in
connection with the indemnification provisions have not been
material. As of September 30, 2025, the Company did not have any
material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably
possible.
Non-income Taxes
The Company may be subject to audit by various tax authorities with
regard to non-income tax matters. The subject matter of non-income
tax audits primarily arises from different interpretations on tax
treatment and tax rates applied. The Company accrues liabilities
for non-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any
negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when a loss is
probable and reasonably estimable. If a loss is reasonably possible
and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, the Company
discloses the reasonably possible loss.

In February 2022, the Company's board of directors authorized a
stock repurchase program for the Company's Class A common stock. As
of December 31, 2024, $ 2.3billion remained available for
repurchases under the program. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2025, the Company repurchased and subsequently
retired 4.9million shares of Class A common stock for an aggregate
amount, including commissions and fees, of $ 1.8billion. As of
September 30, 2025, $ 492.2million remained available for
repurchases under the program.

Repurchases may be made from time to time through open market
purchases or through privately negotiated transactions, subject to
market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant
factors. Open market repurchases may be structured to occur in
accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). The Company
may also, from time to time, enter into Rule 10b-5 trading plans,
to facilitate repurchases of shares. The repurchase program does
not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of Class
A common stock, has no expiration date and may be modified,
suspended, or terminated at any time at the Company's discretion.

The Company retires its Class A common stock upon repurchases, and
records the excess of repurchase price over par value for shares
repurchased to retained earnings to the extent the Company has
retained earnings. If the Company has an accumulated deficit, the
Company records the excess of repurchase price over par value for
shares repurchased first to additional paid-in capital, to the
extent the Company has additional paid-in capital, until depleted,
and then to accumulated deficit in the Company’s condensed
consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity.

The Company maintains threeequity compensation plans that provide
for the issuance of shares of its common stock to the Company’s
employees, directors, consultants and other service providers: the
2021 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2021 Plan"), the 2021 Partner
Studio Incentive Plan, and the 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
(the "ESPP"). There were no material equity award issuances during
the nine months ended September 30, 2025.

  10. Earnings Per Share                                           
                                                                   
The rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the
holders of Class A and Class B common stock are identical, except
with respect to voting and conversion. Each share of Class A common
stock is entitled to onevote per share and each share of Class B
common stock is entitled to 20votes per share. Each share of Class
B common stock is convertible into one share of Class A common
stock voluntarily at any time by the holder, and automatically upon
certain events. The Class A common stock has no conversion rights.
As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical for Class A
and Class B common stock, the undistributed earnings are allocated
on a proportional basis and the resulting net income per share
attributable to common stockholders will, therefore, be the same
for both Class A and Class B common stock on an individual or
combined basis.

The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in foreign
jurisdictions. The Company bases the interim tax accruals on an
estimated annual effective tax rate applied to year-to-date income
and records the discrete tax items in the period to which they
relate. Each quarter, the Company updates the estimated annual
effective tax rate and makes a year-to-date adjustment to the tax
provision as necessary. The Company’s calendar year 2025 annual
effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate primarily
due to jurisdictional mix of earnings, global minimum tax, foreign
tax credits, foreign derived intangible income deduction, and
global intangible low-taxed

income.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, there were no
material changes to the Company's unrecognized tax benefits, and
the Company does not expect material changes in unrecognized tax
benefits within the next twelve months.

On July 4, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (“OBBBA”) was
enacted in the U.S. The OBBBA includes significant provisions, such
as the permanent extension of certain expiring provisions of the
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, modifications to the international tax
framework and the restoration of favorable tax treatment for
certain business provisions. The legislation has multiple effective
dates, with certain provisions effective in 2025 and others
implemented through 2027. The Company has evaluated the OBBBA
provisions which became effective during the quarter and estimated
their impact on the consolidated financial statements to be
immaterial. The Company will continue to evaluate the full impact
of these legislative changes as additional guidance becomes
available.
                                                                   
  12. Segment                                                      
                                                                   
The Company determines its operating segments based on how its
chief operating decision maker ("CODM") manages the business,
allocates resources, makes operating decisions and evaluates
operating performance. The Company’s CODM is its Chief Executive
Officer.

As disclosed in Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies and Note 2 – Discontinued
Operations, on June 30, 2025, the Company completed the divestiture
of its Apps Business, which constituted the former Apps segment.
Following the divestiture, the Company has determined that it
currently operates the remaining business as a single operating and
reportable segment at the consolidated level. Accordingly, the
Company classified the Apps Business as discontinued operations in
its condensed consolidated statements of operations and excluded
the Apps Business from both continuing operations and segment
results for all periods presented. The Company’s single segment
provides end-to-end advertising solutions including Axon
Advertising, MAX, Adjust, and Wurl, that allow businesses to reach,
monetize and grow their global audiences. Revenue is primarily
generated from fees paid by advertisers for the placement of ads on
mobile applications owned by Publishers.

As a single reportable segment entity, the Company has determined
that its measure of profit or loss is net income from continuing
operations, which is the measure most consistent with U.S. GAAP.
The CODM uses net income from continuing operations to allocate
resources during the annual budgeting and forecasting process,
evaluate operating strategies, and assess performance across
periods.
The table below is a summary of the segment net income from
continuing operations, including significant segment expenses (in
thousands):

In March 2025, the Company borrowed $ 200.0million under its
revolving credit facility pursuant to the credit agreement entered
in 2024 to fund share repurchases under the Company's repurchase
program. For additional information regarding the share
repurchases, see Note 8 - Equity. The Company repaid $ 100.0million
of the outstanding borrowings in April 2025 and the remaining $
100.0million in May 2025. As of September 30, 2025, $ 1.0billion
remained available for borrowing under the facility.

KKR Denali

In February 2024, the Company entered into an underwriting
agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) with KKR Denali, and BofA
Securities, Inc., acting for themselves and as representative of
other underwriters (collectively, the “Underwriters”), in
connection with a secondary public offering (the “Offering”) of
19.9million shares of the Company's Class A common stock by KKR
Denali. Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, on March 6, 2024,
the Company repurchased from the Underwriters 10.5million shares of
Class A common stock sold to the Underwriters by KKR Denali in the
O ffering at a price per share of $ 54.46, the same per share price
paid by the Underwriters to KKR Denali in the Offering. In
connection with the Offering, KKR Denali converted 16.0million
shares of Class B common stock to Class A common stock.

Humans, Inc.

In February 2024, the Company entered into an agreement to invest $
50.0million in the Series C preferred stock financing of Humans,
Inc., the developer of the Flip Shop social shopping app ("Flip
Shop"). Eduardo Vivas, a member of the Company's board of
directors, served as the Chief Operating Officer of Humans, Inc.,
and a member of its board of directors until his resignation from
both positions in September 2025.

Concurrently, the Company also entered into an arm's length
commercial agreement with Humans, Inc. to provide access to Axon
AI, the Company's advertising recommendation engine, under a
revenue share model. No transactions have occurred under this
agreement to date.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, the Company
recognized an immaterialamount in revenue from Humans, Inc. related
to their use of the Axon Platform. The transactions were conducted
at arm’s-length pricing and under standard contractual terms.
During the same period, the Company recorded a full impairment of
its $ 50.0million investment in Humans, Inc. as a result of its
deteriorating financial condition and uncertainty about its ability
to continue as a going concern.

Other

In March 2019, the Company entered into a promissory note with
Rafael Vivas, the brother of Eduardo Vivas, a member of the
Company's board of directors, for the purpose of advancing him
funds to allow him to early exercise his stock options (“Vivas
Note”). The Vivas Note was issued in the amount of $ 2.3million at
an interest rate of 2.59%, and later amended on August 7, 2020 to
lower the interest rate on the outstanding balance of such note to
the then applicable IRS annual mid-term rate of 0.41%. On March 8,
2024, the principal amount due under the Vivas Note plus accrued
interest, or $ 2.3million, was repaid in full to the Company and
the Vivas Note was extinguished.

The Company had no other material related party transactions for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024.
                                                                   
  15. Subsequent Events                                            
                                                                   
In October 2025, the Company’s board of directors authorized an
increase to the repurchase program of $ 3.2billion, such that an
aggregate amount of approximately $ 3.3billion remained available
for repurchases as of October 31, 2025. For additional information,
see Note 8 – Equity.

In October 2025, the Company granted 0.9million performance-based
restricted stock units (“PSUs”) under its 2021 Equity Incentive
Plan to certain key non-executive engineering employees. The PSUs
are eligible to vest upon the achievement of certain market
capitalization milestones and continued service through the
applicable vesting dates. The estimated grant-date fair value of
these awards was $ 410.5million.

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition
and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our
condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes
included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-
looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Factors
that could cause or contribute to such differences include those
identified below and those discussed in the section titled “Risk
Factors” and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our
historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results
that may be expected for any period in the future.
                                                                   
   Overview                                                        
                                                                   
Our mission is to create meaningful connections between companies
and their ideal customers. We provide end-to-end software and AI-
powered solutions for businesses to reach, monetize and grow their
global audience. Our scaled business model is intricately linked to
the advertising ecosystem, providing a durable competitive
advantage. We generate revenue when our advertisers achieve their
return on ad spend targets with our advertising solutions, ensuring
that their success directly fuels our growth.

Since our founding in 2011, we have been focused on building
advertising solutions for advertisers to improve the marketing and
monetization of their content. Our founders, who were mobile app
developers themselves, quickly realized the real impediment to
success and growth in the advertising ecosystem was a discovery and
monetization problem—breaking through the congested app stores to
efficiently find users and successfully grow their business. Their
first-hand experience with these challenges led to the development
of our infrastructure and advertising solutions.

For the three months ended September 30, 2025, our revenue
increased 68% year-over-year to $1.4 billion, from $835.2 million
in the three months ended September 30, 2024. We generated net
income from continuing operations of $835.5 million and $433.1
million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024,
respectively, and net income of $835.5 million and $434.4 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024,
respectively. We generated Adjusted EBITDA of $1.2 billion and
$647.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and
2024, respectively. Additionally, our net cash provided by
operating activities was $2.7 billion and $1.4 billion in the nine
months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. We
generated Free Cash Flow of $2.6 billion and $1.4 billion for the
nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Cash
flows and Free Cash Flow include the cash flows from continuing and
discontinued operations. Given our strong financial position, we
have been able to reinvest in our expansion and growth, and
repurchase and withhold shares of our Class A common stock. See the
section titled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a definition of
Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net
income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated
in accordance with GAAP.
                                                                   
  Recent Developments                                              
                                                                   
On May 7, 2025, we, along with our subsidiaries Morocco, Inc. and
AppLovin GmbH (collectively, the “Sellers”) entered into a Purchase
Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Tripledot and its subsidiaries
Eton Games Inc. ("Eton") and Tripledot Group Holdings Limited
(collectively, with Tripledot, the “Purchasers”) relating to the
sale of our Apps Business. On June 30, 2025, we and Tripledot
entered into an amendment to the Agreement to provide, among other
things, that in lieu of the issuance of a secured promissory note
by Eton to us or our designated affiliate at the closing of the
transactions contemplated by the Agreement (the “Closing”) to fund
a portion of the full Cash Consideration (as defined in the
Agreement), Tripledot may elect to pay such amount in cash.

On June 30, 2025, we completed the Closing and sold our Apps
Business to Tripledot for $400 million in cash, subject to closing
adjustments, and equity consideration representing approximately
20% of Tripledot’s fully-diluted equity at the time of closing. No
promissory note was issued as part of the transaction. Following
the Closing, we operate as a single operating and reportable
segment. Results related to our Apps Business are presented as
discontinued operations in our condensed consolidated financial
statements. See Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies and Note 2 – Discontinued
Operations of the Notes to condensed consolidated financial
statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

We primarily generate revenue from fees paid by advertisers who use
our advertising solutions to grow and monetize their content. We
are able to grow our revenue by improving our various technologies.

Advertising clients include a wide variety of advertisers, from
indie developer studios to some of the largest global internet
platforms, such as Facebook and Google. We see multiple
opportunities to gain new clients, and to increase spend from
existing clients, as we help them grow their businesses and make
them more successful.

Our advertising solutions include Axon Advertising, MAX, Adjust,
and Wurl. Clients use Axon Advertising to automate, optimize, and
manage their user acquisition investments. They set marketing and
user growth goals, and Axon Advertising optimizes their ad spend in
an effort to achieve their return on advertising spend targets and
other marketing objectives. Axon Advertising comprises the vast
majority of revenue. Revenue is generated from our advertisers,
typically on a performance basis, and shared with our advertising
publishers, typically on a cost per impression model.

Advertising clients use MAX to optimize purchases of app
advertising inventory. The MAX tool provides insights to manage
against key performance indicators, understand the long-term value
of users, and help manage profitability. Revenue from MAX is
generated based on a percentage of client spend. As more
advertising networks move to in-app real-time bidding, we expect
growth in the adoption of, and revenue from, MAX.

Advertising clients use Adjust's measurement and analytics
marketing platform to better understand their users' journey while
allowing marketers to make smarter decisions through measurement,
attribution and fraud prevention. Revenue from Adjust is primarily
generated from an annual software subscription fee.

Advertising clients use Wurl's connected TV ("CTV") platform to
distribute streaming video, maximize revenue, and acquire and
retain viewers or subscribers. Revenue from Wurl is primarily
generated from content companies, streamers, and advertisers,
typically on a usage-based and/or CPM model.
                                                                   
   Non-GAAP Financial Measures                                     
                                                                   
                                                                   
  Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin                       
                                                                   
We define Adjusted EBITDA for a particular period as net income
adjusted for loss (income) from discontinued operations, net of
income taxes, interest expense, other (income) expense, net
(excluding certain recurring items), provision for income taxes,
amortization, depreciation and write-offs and as further adjusted
for stock-based compensation, transaction-related expense,
restructuring costs, and non-operating foreign exchange gain, as
well as certain other items that we believe are not reflective of
our core operating performance. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as
Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue for the same period.

Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are key measures we use
to assess our financial performance and are also used for internal
planning and forecasting purposes. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and
Adjusted EBITDA margin are helpful to investors, analysts, and
other interested parties because they can assist in providing a
more consistent and comparable overview of our operations across
our historical financial periods. In addition, these measures are
frequently used by analysts, investors, and other interested
parties to evaluate and assess performance. We use Adjusted EBITDA
and Adjusted EBITDA margin in conjunction with GAAP measures as
part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the
preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts,
to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to
communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial
performance.

Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are non-GAAP financial
measures and are presented for supplemental informational purposes
only and should not be considered as alternatives or substitutes to
financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. These
measures have certain limitations in that they do not include the
impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated
statement of operations that are necessary to run our business. Our
definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies
and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other
companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Thus, our
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin should be considered in
addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures
prepared in accordance with GAAP.

We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating
activities less purchases of property and equipment and principal
payment of finance leases. We use Free Cash Flow to help manage the
health of our business, prepare budgets and for capital allocation
purposes. We believe Free Cash Flow provides useful supplemental
information to help investors understand underlying trends in our
business and our liquidity. Free Cash Flow also reflects cash flows
from both continuing and discontinued operations. Our definition
may differ from the definitions used by other companies and
therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other
companies may not publish Free Cash Flow or similar metrics. Thus,
our Free Cash Flow should be considered in addition to, not as a
substitute for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in
accordance with GAAP.

We believe that the future success of our business depends on many
factors, including the factors described below. While each of these
factors presents significant opportunities for our business, they
also pose important
                                23

challenges that we must successfully address in order to continue
to grow profitably while maintaining strong cash flow.
                                                                   
  Continue to invest in innovation                                 
                                                                   
We have made, and intend to continue to make, significant
investments in our advertising solutions to enhance their
effectiveness and value proposition for our clients. We expect that
these investments will require spending on research and development
and acquisitions and partnerships related to technology components
and products. We believe investments in our technology, including
Axon AI, our advertising recommendation engine, Axon Advertising,
Adjust, and MAX, will further improve effectiveness for
advertisers. In addition, we plan to continue to invest in the AI-
based, self-learning capabilities of our advertising recommendation
engine, Axon AI. Our investments will also allow us to enter into
and expand into new verticals outside of gaming, such as e-commerce
and CTV. While our investments in research and development and
acquisitions and partnerships may not result in revenue in the near
term, we believe these investments position us to increase our
revenue over time.
                                                                   
  Retain and grow existing clients                                 
                                                                   
We rely on existing clients for a significant portion of our
revenue. As we improve our advertising solutions, we can attract
additional spend from these clients. Our clients include indie
studio developers and some of the largest advertising platforms in
the world. We believe there is significant room for us to further
expand our relationships with these clients and increase their
usage of our advertising solutions.

In the past, our clients have generally increased their usage of
our advertising solutions, and as a result, growth from existing
clients has been a primary driver of our revenue growth. We must
continue to retain our existing clients and expand their spend with
us over time to continue to grow our revenue, increase
profitability and drive greater cash flow.
                                                                   
  Add new clients globally                                         
                                                                   
Our future success depends in part on our ability to acquire new
clients. During the three months ended September 30, 2025, 51% of
our revenue was generated from outside of the United States. We
believe that the global opportunity is significant and will
continue to expand as developers and advertisers outside the United
States adopt our advertising solutions. We also see opportunities
to acquire new clients outside of mobile gaming, as the
capabilities of our advertising solutions are relevant to the
broader advertising ecosystem, including in areas such as
e-commerce. For example, in October 2025 we opened a public
referral program to onboard customers to Axon Ads Manager, which we
expect to launch more broadly in the first half of 2026. We are
investing in direct sales, product development, education, and
other capabilities to drive increased awareness and adoption of our
advertising solutions, which investments may impact our
profitability in the near term as we seek further scale.
                                                                   
  Continued execution of strategic partnerships                    
                                                                   
We continue to explore strategic partnership opportunities related
to our advertising solutions and the expansion of the markets it
serves and we may from time to time evaluate strategic acquisitions
and partnerships opportunistically. We believe our future results
of operations will be affected by our ability to continue to
identify and execute such strategic transactions that are accretive
to our growth and profitability. In April 2025, we provided an
indication of interest to the President of the United States to
explore a purchase of TikTok in all markets outside of China. This
indication of interest is preliminary and there can be no assurance
that a transaction involving us will proceed.
Growth and structure of the mobile app and advertising ecosystems
Our business and results of operations are, and will continue to
be, impacted by industry factors that drive the overall performance
of the mobile app and advertising ecosystems. Mobile app developers
rely on third-party platforms, such as the Apple App Store and
Google Play Store, among others, to distribute games, collect
payments made for IAPs, and target users with relevant advertising.
We expect this to continue for the foreseeable future. These third-
party platforms have significant market power and discretion to set
platform fees, select which apps to promote, and decide how much
consumer information to provide to advertising networks that enable
our advertising solutions to target users with personalized and
relevant advertising and allocate marketing campaigns in an
efficient and cost-effective manner. Any changes made to the
policies of third-party platforms could drive rapid change across
the mobile app and advertising ecosystems. For example, in April
2021, Apple started implementing its application tracking
transparency framework that, among other things, requires users'
opt-in consent for certain types of tracking. While this
transparency framework has not had a significant impact on our
overall business, it may do so in the future, including with
respect to the effectiveness of our advertising practices. We rely
in part on Identifier for Advertisers ("IDFA") to provide us with
data that helps our advertising solutions better market and
                                24

monetize mobile apps. In light of the IDFA and transparency
changes, we made changes to our data collection practices.
Additionally, Apple implemented new requirements for consumer
disclosures regarding privacy and data processing practices in
December 2020, which has resulted in increased compliance
requirements. Apple incorporated new SDK privacy controls into iOS
17, which was released in September 2023, including privacy
manifests and signatures designed to allow app developers to
outline the data practices for SDKs embedded in their apps, manage
tracking domains within SDKs, and curb device fingerprinting by
requiring app developers to select allowed reasons for using data
received through certain APIs. In February 2022, Google announced
its Privacy Sandbox initiative for Android, a multi-year effort
aimed at reducing cross-app tracking and limiting reliance on user
identifiers. However, in October 2025, Google announced its plans
to retire several Privacy Sandbox technologies for both Chrome and
Android. In January 2024, Google commenced rolling out a Chrome
feature, called Tracking Protection, which limits cross-site
tracking. In May 2023, Google announced new consent management
platform ("CMP") requirements for ads served in the European
Economic Area ("EEA") and UK, which requires, as of January 2024,
publishers using Google AdSense, Ad Manager, or AdMob to use a CMP
that has been certified by Google and has integrated with the
Interactive Advertising Bureau’s (“IAB”) Transparency and Consent
Framework when serving ads to users in the EEA or the UK. While to
date these third-party platform privacy changes have had some
impact on the discoverability of apps across these platforms and
have had a relatively muted aggregate impact on our results of
operations, the ultimate impact of these or any similar or future
changes to the policies of Apple or Google could adversely affect
our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

New tools for developers, industry standards, and platforms may
emerge in the future. We believe our focus on the advertising
ecosystem has allowed us to understand the needs of our clients and
our relentless innovation has enabled us to quickly adapt to
changes in the industry and pioneer new solutions. We must continue
to innovate and stay ahead of developments in the advertising and
mobile app ecosystems in order for our business to succeed and our
results of operations to continue to improve.

We generate revenue primarily from fees collected from advertisers
spending on Axon Advertising, typically on a performance basis,
then shared with our advertising publishers, typically on a cost
per impression basis. Revenue also includes fees generated based on
a percentage of client spend through MAX and subscription fees for
Adjust's measurement and analytics marketing platform. Revenue from
other services was not material. Revenue does not include the
results of our former Apps Business, which is classified as
discontinued operations.

Cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of amortization
of acquired technology-related intangible assets, amortization of
finance lease right-of-use assets related to certain servers and
networking equipment, and data center costs related primarily to
third-party cloud computing services. We expect our cost of revenue
to increase in absolute dollars over the long term as our business
and revenue continue to grow. We also expect our cost of revenue as
a percentage of revenue to fluctuate period-over-period .

Sales and marketing . Sales and marketing expenses consist
primarily of marketing programs and other advertising expenses,
professional services costs, personnel-related expenses including
salaries, employee benefits, and stock-based compensation for
employees engaged in sales and marketing activities, amortization
of acquired user-related intangible assets, travel and allocated
facilities and information technology costs.

We plan to continue to invest in sales and marketing to grow our
advertising customer base and increase brand awareness. We expect
sales and marketing expenses to fluctuate period-over-period in
absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in the near term as
we invest to grow our customer base and increase brand awareness,
and to decrease as a percentage of revenue over the long term as we
benefit from greater scale.

Research and development. Research and development expenses consist
primarily of product development costs, including personnel-related
expenses such as salaries, employee benefits, and stock-based
compensation for employees engaged in research and development
activities, professional services costs, consulting costs,
regulatory compliance costs, and allocated facilities and
information technology costs.

We plan to continue to invest in research and development to
continue to enhance our advertising solutions. We expect our
research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue to
fluctuate period-over-period in the near term as we invest to
enhance our advertising solutions and to decrease over the long
term as we benefit from greater scale.

General and administrative . General and administrative expenses
consist primarily of costs incurred to support our business,
including personnel-related expenses such as salaries, employee
benefits, and stock-based compensation for employees engaged in
finance, accounting, legal, human resources and administration,
professional services fees for legal, accounting, recruiting, and
administrative services (including acquisition or other
transaction-related expenses), insurance, travel, and allocated
facilities and information technology costs.

We plan to continue to invest in our general and administrative
function to support the growth of our business. We expect our
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue to
fluctuate period-over-period in the near term as we invest to
support the growth of our business, and to decrease over the long
term as we benefit from greater scale.

Interest expense. Interest expense consists primarily of interest
expense associated with our outstanding debt, including accretion
of debt discount, and issuance costs.

Other income (expense), net. Other income (expense), net, primarily
includes interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents, fair
value adjustments relating to our non-marketable equity securities,
and foreign currency gains and losses.

Provision for income taxes. We are subject to income taxes in the
United States and foreign jurisdictions in which we do business.
These foreign jurisdictions have different statutory tax rates than
those in the United States. Additionally, certain of our foreign
earnings may also be taxable in the United States. Accordingly, our
effective tax rate will vary depending on the relative proportion
of foreign to domestic income, impacts from acquisition
restructuring, deduction benefits related to foreign-derived
intangible income, future changes in the valuation of our deferred
tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws. Additionally,
our effective tax rate can vary based on the amount of pre-tax

In the three months ended September 30, 2025, other income
(expense), net decreased by $15.0 million compared to the same
period in the prior year, due primarily to a net fair value
remeasurement loss of $20.4 million related to our investments in
non-marketable equity securities in the current period, partially
offset by an increase in interest income of $7.4 million driven by
an increase in cash and cash equivalents.

In the nine months ended September 30, 2025, other income
(expense), net decreased by $39.3 million compared to the same
period in the prior year, due primarily to a net fair value

In the three months ended September 30, 2025, the provision for
income taxes increased by $150.7 million compared to the same
period in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by
higher pre-tax income from business operations during the three
months ended September 30, 2025 and global minimum tax, offset by
foreign income taxed at different rates.

In the nine months ended September 30, 2025, the provision for
income taxes increased by $284.8 million compared to the same
period in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by
higher pre-tax income from business operations during the nine
months ended September 30, 2025 and global minimum tax, offset by
higher stock-based compensation benefit and foreign income taxed at
different rates.

As of September 30, 2025, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1.7
billion, consisting primarily of cash on deposit with banks and
short-term liquid investments in money market deposit accounts. We
believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flows
expected to be generated by our operations, and, if necessary, our
borrowing capacity under our credit agreement, which provided $1.0
billion of remaining availability as of September 30, 2025, would
be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated working capital and
capital expenditures needs for at least the next 12 months. Our
future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including
our revenue growth rate; sales and marketing activities; timing and
extent of spending to support our research and development efforts;
capital expenditures to purchase hardware and software; our
continued need to invest in our IT infrastructure to support our
growth; and the volume and timing of our stock repurchases. In
addition, we may enter into additional strategic partnerships as
well as agreements to acquire or invest in teams and technologies,
including intellectual property rights, which could increase our
cash requirements. As a result of these and other factors, we may
be required to seek additional equity or debt financing sooner than
we currently anticipate, or we may opportunistically seek
additional financing. See the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks
Related to Financial and Accounting Matters” for more information
regarding risks related to liquidity and capital resources.

indicated (all periods include cash flows from continuing and
discontinued operations):

  Operating Activities                                             
                                                                   
Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.7 billion for the
nine months ended September 30, 2025, primarily driven by net
income of $2.2 billion, adjusted for non-cash items, including
$188.9 million of goodwill impairment, $162.0 million of
amortization, depreciation, and write-offs, $130.2 million of
stock-based compensation expense and $50.0 million of impairment of
non-marketable equity securities, which were partially offset by a
gain from the divestiture of our Apps Business, net of transaction
costs, of $106.2 million and a net decrease in operating assets and
liabilities of $29.9 million.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.4 billion for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by net
income of $980.6 million, adjusted for non-cash items, including
$320.8 million of amortization, depreciation, and write-offs, and
$275.5 million of stock-based compensation expense, which were
partially offset by a net decrease in operating assets and
liabilities of $196.2 million.

The improvement in cash flows from operating activities during the
nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same period in
the prior year was primarily due to an increase in cash collection
from our customers driven by revenue growth and a decrease of
interest payments on debt as a result of lower interest rates,
partially offset by higher cash operating expenses primarily
associated with operating our network infrastructure, as well as
higher income tax payments due to revenue growth.

Net cash provided by investing activities was $359.3 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2025, primarily driven by
$407.3 million in proceeds from the divestiture of our Apps
Business, net of cash divested, which were partially offset by
$22.4 million in earn-out payments related to prior acquisitions of
intangible assets and $20.2 million in purchases of non-marketable
equity securities.

Net cash used in investing activities was $106.4 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by $77.0
million in purchases of non-marketable equity securities and $18.3
million in earn-out payments related to prior acquisitions of
intangible assets.

withholding taxes related to the net share settlement of equity
awards.

Net cash used in financing activities was $1.2 billion for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by $980.7 million
in stock repurchases under our share repurchase program and $644.4
million in payments for withholding taxes related to the net share
settlement of equity awards, which were partially offset by $1.1
billion in proceeds from debt issuances, net of $686.8 million in
principal repayments of debt, and $28.8 million in proceeds from
exercise of stock options and purchases under our Employee Stock
Purchase Plan.

In March 2025, we borrowed $200.0 million under our revolving
credit facility pursuant to the credit agreement entered in 2024 to
fund share repurchases under our repurchase program. We repaid
$100.0 million of the outstanding principal amount of borrowings in
April 2025 and the remaining $100.0 million of the outstanding
principal amount of borrowings in May 2025. As of September 30,
2025, $1.0 billion remained available for borrowing under the
facility.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we repurchased 4.9
million shares of Class A common stock for an aggregate amount,
including commissions and fees, of $1.8 billion. As of September
30, 2025, $492.2 million remained available for repurchases under
the program. In February 2025, our Board modified our stock
repurchase program such that $500.0 million was immediately
available for repurchase of shares of our Class A common stock,
notwithstanding the amount that otherwise would have remained
available during the quarter under the prior program limitation,
and such limit would be increased in future quarters by the amount
of free cash flow generated in the preceding fiscal quarter, with
such increases to be carried forward and remain available for
future repurchases if not used (up to the total authorized amount
available for repurchases). In October 2025, our board of directors
authorized an increase to the repurchase program of $3.2 billion
and removed the limitations and conditions related to free cash
flow. Following the increase, an aggregate amount of approximately
$3.3 billion remained available for repurchases as of October 31,
2025. Repurchases may be made from time to time through open market
purchases or through privately negotiated transactions, subject to
market conditions, applicable legal requirements, including surplus
and solvency requirements, and other relevant factors. For

Except for scheduled payments from the ongoing business, there were
no other material changes to our commitments under contractual
obligations since December 31, 2024. For additional information,
see Note 6 – Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to
condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of

  Critical Accounting Estimates                                    
                                                                   
Our condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in
accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our condensed consolidated
financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue,
expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate
our estimates based on assumptions that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates are inherently
subject to judgment and actual results could differ materially from
those estimates.

An accounting estimate is considered critical if it involves
significant subjectivity and judgment, and if changes in the
estimate have had or are reasonably likely to have a material
effect on our consolidated financial statements.

There have been no material changes to our critical accounting
estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, as
compared to those disclosed in our Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations set forth
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2024. For additional information on all of our significant
accounting policies, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial
statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2024.

   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures                
                                                                   
Our management, with the participation of our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act), as of the
end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer have concluded that, as of such date,
our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a
reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2025.
                                                                   
  Changes in Internal Control                                      
                                                                   
There were no changes in our internal control over financial
reporting identified in management’s evaluation pursuant to Rules
13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the quarter ended
September 30, 2025 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.
                                                                   
   Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures         
                                                                   
Our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of
achieving their desired objectives. Management does not expect,
however, that our disclosure controls and procedures or our
internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect
all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well
designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions, and can
provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its
objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can
provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud
will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud,
if any, within our company have been detected.

We are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in,
legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of
business, as well as governmental and other regulatory
investigations and proceedings. In addition, third parties have in
the past, and may in the future, assert claims against us in the
form of letters and other communications.

Securities Litigation

Beginning in early March 2025, certain alleged stockholders filed
putative class action complaints against the Company, Adam
Foroughi, Matthew Stumpf, and/or Herald Chen asserting claims for
alleged violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and Rule
10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and seeking unspecified monetary
relief, interest, and attorneys’ fees. On March 5, 2025, Michael
Quiero filed the first complaint against the Company, Adam
Foroughi, and Matthew Stumpf in the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of California (the “Northern District of
California”); on March 24, 2025, Ben Brownback filed the second
complaint in the same court against the Company, Adam Foroughi,
Matthew Stumpf, and Herald Chen in the Northern District of
California (the “Brownback Action”); and on April 17, 2025, the
Wayne County Employees’ Retirement System filed the third complaint
against the Company, Adam Foroughi, Matthew Stumpf, and Herald Chen
in the Northern District of California (collectively, the
“Securities Complaints”). In May 2025, Michael Quiero and the Wayne
County Employees’ Retirement System voluntarily dismissed the
complaints they filed in the Northern District of California. The
U.S. District Court subsequently appointed lead plaintiffs and lead
plaintiffs’ counsel in the Brownback Action, and the lead
plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint on September 12, 2025, adding
Basil Shikin as a defendant. The Amended Complaint alleges that the
defendants made materially false and misleading statements
regarding the Company's advertising solutions and financial growth.
The Amended Complaint alleges a putative class period running from
November 7, 2024 through March 27, 2025. Pursuant to the current
scheduling order, the parties will file submissions in support of,
and in opposition to, the defendants’ anticipated motion to dismiss
through early February 2026. We believe that these allegations lack
merit and will vigorously contest this action.

Shareholder Derivative Litigation

Beginning in late March 2025, certain alleged shareholders filed
shareholder derivative complaints in the Northern District of
California against the individual then current members of the
Company’s board of directors, Adam Foroughi, and Matthew Stumpf
(collectively, the “D&O Parties”) alleging claims for violations of
Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, breaches of their fiduciary
duties, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement,
and waste of corporate assets (collectively, the “Shareholder
Derivative Complaints”). The Shareholder Derivative Complaints also
assert claims for contribution under the Exchange Act against Adam
Foroughi and Matthew Stumpf and seek unspecified monetary relief,
certain declaratory and injunctive relief, restitution, and
attorneys’ fees from the D&O Parties. Relying on the Securities
Complaints, the Shareholder Derivative Complaints allege that the
D&O Parties made materially false and misleading statements
regarding our advertising solutions and financial growth. On March
25, 2025, Amit Patel filed the first complaint against the
individual then current members of the Company’s board of
directors, Adam Foroughi, and Matthew Stumpf in the Northern
District of California; and on May 19, 2025, Nathan Smith filed the
second complaint against the individual then current members of the
Company’s board of directors, Adam Foroughi, and Matthew Stumpf in
the Northern District of California. The Shareholder Derivative
Complaints have been consolidated and stayed pending resolution of
the defendants’ anticipated motion to dismiss in the Brownback
Action. We believe that these allegations lack merit and will
vigorously contest these actions.

While we remain confident in the Company’s defenses to the asserted
allegations in these cases, it is not possible to determine the
ultimate outcome at this time, and thus we cannot reasonably
estimate the maximum potential exposure or range of possible loss.

Future litigation may be necessary to defend ourselves and our
business partners and to determine the scope, enforceability, and
validity of third-party proprietary rights, or to establish our
proprietary rights. The results of any current or future litigation
cannot be predicted with certainty, and regardless of the outcome,
litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and
settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other
factors.

You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described
below, together with all of the other information in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q, including the section titled “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations” and our unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements and the related notes, before making a decision to
invest in our Class A common stock. Our business, financial
condition, results of operations, or prospects could also be
adversely affected by risks and uncertainties that are not
presently known to us or that we currently believe are not
material. If any of the risks actually occur, our business,
financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be
adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our Class A
common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your
investment.

Our results of operations are likely to fluctuate from period-to-
period, which could cause the market price of our Class A common
stock to decline.

Our results of operations have fluctuated in the past and are
likely to fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-
to-year in the future for a variety of reasons, many of which are
outside of our control and difficult to predict. As a result, you
should not rely upon our historical results of operations as
indicators of future performance. Numerous factors can influence
our results of operations, including:

• our ability to maintain and grow our client and user bases;

• changes to our advertising solutions or other offerings;

• the timing and efficacy of improvements to our algorithms, models
and Axon AI, our advertising recommendation engine, generally;

• the development and introduction of new solutions or entry into
new markets by us or our competitors;

the mix of income we earn in the United States and in jurisdictions
with comparatively lower tax rates;

• the impact of changes in tax laws or judicial or regulatory
interpretations of tax laws, which are recorded in the period such
laws are enacted or interpretations are issued and may
significantly affect the effective tax rate of that period;

• the impact of tariffs recently imposed by the U.S. government and
its trading partners in response, other possible tariffs or trade
protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, new
or different customs duties, trade embargoes and sanctions and
other trade barriers;

• the application of new or changing financial accounting standards
or practices; and

• changes in regional or global business or macroeconomic
conditions, including as a result of political uncertainty and
international conflicts around the world, inflation, and high
interest rates, which may impact the other factors described above.

In particular, it is difficult to predict if, when, or how newly-
launched products, software or new markets may begin to generate
revenue or decline in popularity. Further, we cannot be certain if
a new product will become popular and generate revenue. The success
of our business depends in part on our ability to develop and
enhance our advertising solutions, including expansion into new
markets, and consistently and timely launch new products. It is
difficult for us to predict with certainty when we will expand our
advertising solutions, launch a new product, or enter a new market
as we may require longer development schedules or soft launch
periods to meet our quality standards and expectations. If our
clients do not adopt our new advertising offerings, or develop or
further invest in their own competing alternatives, or if we are
unable to successfully launch or acquire new products or maintain
or improve existing products or successfully enter a new market,
our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.
Fluctuations in our results of operations may cause such results to
fall below our financial guidance or the expectations of analysts
or investors, which could cause the market price of our Class A
common stock to decline.

Security breaches, improper access to or disclosure of our data or
user data, other hacking and phishing attacks on our systems, or
other cyber incidents could harm our reputation and adversely
affect our business.

The advertising and mobile app ecosystems are prone to cyberattacks
by third parties seeking unauthorized access to our data or the
data of our clients or users or to disrupt our ability to provide
service. Our advertising solutions, and other offerings involve the
collection, storage, transmission, and other processing of a large
amount of data, including personal information, and we and our
third-party service providers otherwise store and process
information, including our confidential and proprietary business
information, and personal information and other information
relating to our employees, users, and clients or other third
parties. We also store and implement measures designed to secure
the source code for our advertising solutions as they are created.
Any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches or incidents
impacting our advertising solutions, or our systems or other
systems used in our business, or improper access to or disclosure
of our data, including source code, or user data, including
personal information or content from users, or information from
clients or other third parties, that is stored or otherwise
processed in our business could result in the unauthorized loss,
modification, disclosure, destruction, or other unauthorized
processing of such data, or unavailability of data or of our
advertising solutions, or other offerings. Any such event, or the
perception it has occurred, could adversely affect our business and
reputation, damage our operations, result in claims, litigation, or
regulatory investigations or enforcement actions, fines, penalties,
or other liability or obligations, and diminish our competitive
position. In particular, a breach or incident, whether physical,
electronic, or otherwise, impacting systems on which source code or
other sensitive data are stored could lead to loss, disruption,
unavailability, or piracy of, or damage to, our offerings, lost or
reduced ability to protect our intellectual property, and
diminished competitive position.

Malware (including ransomware), viruses, social engineering
(predominantly spear phishing attacks or smishing), and general
hacking have become more prevalent in the advertising and mobile
app ecosystems. Some of these have occurred on our systems and
otherwise in our business in the past, and we expect they will
continue to occur in the future. We regularly encounter attempts to
create false or undesirable user accounts or take other actions for
purposes such as spamming or other objectionable ends. Any actual
or attempted breaches, incidents, or attacks may cause disruptions
or interruptions to our advertising solutions, or other offerings,
degrade the user experience, impair, disrupt, or interrupt our
systems and networks and other systems and networks used in our
business, or adversely affect our reputation, business, financial
condition, and results of operations. Our efforts to protect our
advertising solutions, and other offerings, our systems and other
systems used in our business, and our data, user data, and
information from clients, partners, and other third parties, and to
disable or otherwise respond to undesirable activities on our
offerings, may also be unsuccessful due to software bugs or other
technical defects, errors, or malfunctions; employee, contractor,
vendor, or partner error or malfeasance, including defects or
vulnerabilities in information technology systems or offerings;
cyberattacks, including attacks designed to disrupt systems or
facilities; breaches of physical security of our facilities or
technical infrastructure; or other threats that evolve.
Additionally, any such breach, incident, attack, malfunction,
defect, or vulnerability, or the perception that any of these has
occurred, may cause clients or users to lose confidence and trust
in our advertising solutions or other offerings and otherwise harm
our reputation and market position.

In addition, some developers or other business partners, such as
those that help us measure the effectiveness of advertisements or
participate in the bidding process, may receive or store
information provided by us or by our clients or users through
mobile or web apps or other means. These third parties or others
may misappropriate or misuse this information. If these third
parties fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security
practices, or experience a breach of, or other security incident
impacting, their networks or systems, our data or our users’ data
may be lost, destroyed, or accessed, modified, disclosed, or
otherwise processed in unauthorized manners. In such an event, or
if such an event is perceived to have occurred, we may suffer
damage to our reputation, may have increased costs arising from the
restoration or implementation of additional security measures and
other costs relating to the incident, and we may face claims,
demands, investigations, and other proceedings by private parties
or governmental actors, and fines, penalties, and other liability
or obligations, any of which could adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations. Any theft or
unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other
confidential business information as a result of such an event
could also adversely affect our business, competitive position, and
results of operations.

Cyberattacks continue to evolve in sophistication and volume, and
may be difficult to detect for long periods. Although we have
developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our
data, user data, and information from our partners; to prevent data
loss, disable undesirable accounts and activities on our
advertising solutions, or other offerings; and to prevent and
detect security breaches, we cannot assure you that such measures
will provide comprehensive security, that we have been or will be
able to identify breaches or other
                                38

incidents or to react to them in a timely manner or that our
remediation efforts will be successful. We experience cyberattacks
and other security incidents of varying degrees from time to time,
and we may incur significant costs in investigating, protecting
against, litigating, or remediating such incidents. We may face
increased risks of cyberattacks and other security incidents as a
result of increases in remote work. Our use of third-party systems
for remote workforce operations introduces security risks and
increased cyberattacks, such as phishing attacks by threat actors
as a method for targeting personnel. Further, in connection with
geopolitical events and conflicts, such as those in Ukraine and the
Middle East, there may be a heightened risk of potential
cyberattacks by state actors or others.

Additionally, our advertising solutions and other offerings operate
in conjunction with, and we are in some cases dependent upon,
third-party products, services, and components. Our ability to
monitor our third-party service providers’ data security is
limited, and in any event, attackers may be able to circumvent our
third-party service providers’ data security measures. There have
been and may continue to be significant attacks on certain third-
party providers, and we cannot guarantee that our or our third-
party providers’ systems and networks have not been breached or
compromised or do not contain defects or bugs that could result in
a disruption, breach, or other incident impacting our systems and
networks or those of third parties that support us and our
advertising solutions. Security vulnerabilities, malicious code,
errors, or other bugs or defects in these third-party products,
services, and components could cause us to face increased costs,
claims, liability, and additional or new obligations, reduced
revenue, and harm to our reputation or competitive position. We and
our service providers may be unable to anticipate these techniques,
react, remediate or otherwise address any security vulnerability,
breach or other security incident in a timely manner, or implement
adequate preventative measures.

Further, we utilize AI technologies in our advertising solutions
and in our business operations and may expand such use in the
future. Our use of AI technologies, and the use of AI technologies
in third-party products and services, may create additional
cybersecurity risks or increase cybersecurity risks, including
risks of security breaches and incidents, and related liability and
harm to our reputation. AI technologies may also be used in
connection with certain cybersecurity attacks, resulting in
heightened risks of security breaches and incidents.

In addition to our efforts to mitigate cybersecurity risks, we are
working to combat misuse of our services and user data by third
parties. We may not discover all such incidents or related
activities, in connection with these efforts, and we may instead be
notified of such incidents or activity by users, clients, the
media, or other third parties. Such incidents and activities have
in the past, and may in the future, include the processing of user
data or use of our systems in manners inconsistent with our terms,
contracts or policies, the existence of false or undesirable user
accounts, improper advertising practices, spamming, or unsecured
datasets, and may also include activities that threaten people's
safety, or scraping, or data harvesting. We may also be
unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our policies or otherwise
remediate or respond to any such incidents effectively or in a
timely manner. Any of the foregoing developments, or any reports of
them occurring or the perception that any of them has occurred,
could adversely affect user trust and engagement, harm our brand
and reputation, require us to change our business practices, result
in claims, demands, investigations, and other proceedings by
private parties or governmental actors, and fines, penalties, and
other liability or obligations, and adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.

We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United
States and abroad relating to cybersecurity and data protection,
some of which provide a private right of action. Many jurisdictions
have enacted breach notification obligations, and our agreements
with certain customers or partners may require us to notify them or
fulfill other obligations in the event of a security breach or
incident. Affected users or government authorities could initiate
legal or regulatory actions against us in connection with any
actual or perceived security breaches or incidents, insufficient
security practices, or improper access to, or disclosure of, or
other processing of data, or other cybersecurity issues which have
occurred in the past or may occur in the future, and which could
cause us to incur significant expense and liability, distract
management and technical personnel, and result in orders or consent
decrees forcing us to modify our business practices and to pay
fines or penalties. Such actual or perceived breaches or other
incidents or our efforts to remediate these events may also result
in a decline in our active user base or engagement levels. Any of
these events could adversely affect our reputation, business,
financial condition, or results of operations.

Our insurance coverage may not extend to all types of privacy or
security breaches or other incidents, and it may be insufficient to
cover all costs and expenses associated with such events. Further,
such insurance may not continue to be available to us in the future
on economically reasonable terms, or at all, and insurers may deny
us coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one
or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance
coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies,
including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible
or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect
on our
                                39

business, including our reputation, financial condition, or results
of operations.

If third-party platforms change their policies in a way that
restricts our business, including the design and effectiveness of
our advertising solutions, or increases our expenses, our business,
financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely
affected.

The mobile app ecosystem depends in part on a relatively small
number of third-party distribution platforms, such as the Apple App
Store, the Google Play Store, and Facebook, some of which are
direct competitors. We are subject to the standard policies and
terms of service of such third-party platforms, which generally
govern the promotion, distribution, content, and operation of
applications on such platforms. Each platform provider has broad
discretion to change and interpret its terms of service and other
policies with respect to us and other mobile app companies, and
those changes may be unfavorable to us. A platform provider may
also change its fee structure, add fees associated with access to
and use of its platform, alter how mobile apps are labeled or are
able to advertise on its platform, change how the personal
information of its users is made available to developers on its
platform, limit the use of personal information for advertising
purposes, restrict how users can share information on its platform
or across platforms, or significantly increase the level of
compliance or requirements necessary to use its platform.

For example, since 2021, Apple has implemented an application
tracking transparency framework that, among other things, requires
users' opt-in consent for certain tracking. While this framework
has not had a significant impact on our overall business, it may in
the future, including with respect to the effectiveness of our
advertising practices. We rely in part on IDFA to provide us with
data that helps our advertising solutions better market and
monetize mobile apps. Apple also implemented new requirements for
consumer disclosures regarding privacy and data processing
practices in December 2020, which has resulted in increased
compliance requirements. In light of the IDFA and transparency
changes, we made changes to our data collection practices. To the
extent we are unable to utilize IDFA or a similar offering, or if
these or future transparency changes and any related opt-in or
other requirements result in decreases in the availability or
utility of data relating to mobile apps, our advertising solutions
may not be as effective and our revenue and results of operations
may be harmed. Apple also incorporated new SDK privacy controls
into iOS 17, released in September 2023.

Similarly, in February 2022, Google announced its Privacy Sandbox
initiative for Android, a multi-year effort aimed at reducing
cross-app tracking and limiting reliance on user identifiers.
However, in October 2025, Google announced its plans to retire
several Privacy Sandbox technologies for both Chrome and Android.
In January 2024, Google commenced rolling out a Chrome feature
called Tracking Protection, which limits cross-site tracking.
Additionally, in January 2024, Google started to roll out new CMP
requirements for ads served in the EEA and UK, which require
publishers using Google AdSense, Ad Manager, or AdMob to use CMPs
certified by Google and integrated with the IAB's Transparency and
Consent Framework when serving ads to users in the EEA or the UK.
According to Google, publishers that do not comply will be limited
to serving only non-personalized ads in these regions. To adapt to
these changes, we released the MAX SDK version 12.0.0 to support
integration with Google's CMP solution. While to date these third-
party platform privacy changes have had some impact on the
discoverability of apps across these platforms, and have had a
relatively muted aggregate impact on our results of operations, the
ultimate impact of these or any similar or future changes to the
policies of Apple or Google may adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.

Distribution platform providers from time to time limit, suspend or
discontinue access to their platforms in connection with
violations, or perceived violations, of terms of service. In
addition, any change or deterioration in our relationship with such
distribution provider may impact our access to its platform.

We also rely on the continued popularity, user adoption, and
functionality of third-party platforms. In the past, some of these
platform providers have been unavailable for short periods of time
or experienced issues with their in-app purchasing functionality.
If issues arise with third-party platforms that impact the design
or effectiveness of our advertising solutions, our business,
financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely
affected.

We are highly dependent on our co-founder and chief executive
officer, as well as our senior management team. We operate a lean
organizational structure and our business and growth may be
adversely affected if we fail to attract, retain, and motivate key
personnel.

Our future success depends in significant part on the continued
service of our key management and engineering personnel, including
our co-founder, CEO, and Chairperson, Adam Foroughi. Our ability to
compete and grow depends in part on the efforts and talents of
these employees and executives, who are important to our vision,
strategic direction, culture, products, and technology. We do not
have employment agreements, other than offer letters, with Mr.
Foroughi or other members of our senior management team, and we do
not maintain key-
                                40

man insurance for members of our senior management team. The loss
of Mr. Foroughi or any other member of our senior management team
could cause disruption and adversely affect our business, financial
condition, or results of operations.

We believe strongly in operating a lean organizational structure,
leveraging technology wherever possible, as it allows us to adapt
our business as needed and affords increased opportunity to our
employees. While this approach enhances efficiency and cost
control, it may also expose us to certain risks. While we believe
our lean culture allows us to move faster than other companies our
size, a lean workforce could limit our ability to scale operations
quickly in response to increased demand, develop new products or
services in a timely manner, or effectively manage multiple
initiatives simultaneously. Additionally, key employees often hold
multiple responsibilities, making us more vulnerable to disruptions
caused by turnover or unexpected absences. If we are unable to
attract, retain, and efficiently allocate personnel, our
operational capabilities, growth potential, and competitive
position could be adversely affected. Furthermore, as we expand, we
may need to hire additional employees and enhance our
infrastructure to support growth. Failure to do so in a timely or
effective manner could strain our existing workforce and negatively
impact our financial performance and strategic objectives.

In addition, our ability to execute our strategy depends in part on
our continued ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and
retain highly skilled employees, particularly in the competitive
fields of AI development, machine learning, product management,
engineering, and data science. We believe that our corporate
culture has been an important factor in our ability to hire and
retain key employees, and if we are unable to maintain our
corporate culture as we grow, we may be unable to foster the
innovation, creativity, and teamwork we believe we need to support
our growth. While we believe we compete favorably, competition for
highly skilled employees is intense, particularly in Silicon
Valley, where our headquarters is located. Interviewing, hiring,
and integrating new employees has been and will continue to be
challenging as we continue to navigate the global working
environment. If we are unable to identify, hire, and retain highly
skilled employees, our business, financial condition, and results
of operations could be adversely affected.

Our company culture has contributed to our success and if we cannot
maintain this culture as we grow, our business could be harmed.

We believe that our company culture has been critical to our
success and will be important for our continued growth. We face a
number of challenges that may affect our ability to sustain our
corporate culture, including: failure to identify, attract, reward,
and retain people in critical technical and leadership positions in
our organization who share and further our culture and values; the
increasing size and geographic diversity of our workforce;
competitive pressures to move in directions that may divert us from
our culture and values; the continued challenges of a rapidly-
evolving industry; the increasing need to develop expertise in new
areas of business that affect us; a negative perception of our
treatment of employees or our response to employee sentiment
related to political or social causes or actions of management; and
the integration of new personnel and businesses from acquisitions.
If we are not able to maintain our culture, we could lose the
innovation, passion, and dedication of our team and as a result,
our business, financial condition, and results of operations could
be adversely affected.

The failure to attract new clients, the loss of clients, or a
reduction in spending by these clients could adversely affect our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Our revenue is mostly from Axon Advertising and is generated from
our advertisers, typically on a performance-based basis, then
shared with our advertising publishers, typically on a cost per
impression model. As is common in the advertising ecosystem, our
clients do not have long-term advertising commitments with us. Our
success depends in part on our ability to satisfy our advertising
partners.

Revenue could also be impacted by a number of other factors,
including:

• our ability to attract and retain clients, including, for
example, in new markets such as e-commerce and social;

• our ability to improve the effectiveness and predictability of
our advertising and maintain and improve Axon AI, our advertising
recommendation engine;

• our ability to maintain or increase advertiser demand and third-
party publisher supply, the quantity or quality of advertisements
shown to users, or our pricing of advertisements;

• changes in measuring or pricing of mobile or other advertising
markets;

• our ability to recruit, train, and retain personnel to support
continued growth of our advertising solutions;

• our ability to establish and maintain our brand and reputation;
                                41

• loss of market share to our competitors, including if competitors
offer lower priced, more integrated, or otherwise more effective
products;

• the development and success of technologies designed to block the
display of advertisements or block our ad measurement tools, which
have in the past impacted and may in the future impact our
business, or technologies that make it easier for users to opt out
of behavioral targeting;

• the availability, accuracy, utility, and security of analytics
and measurement solutions offered by us or third parties that
demonstrate the value of our advertising solutions to advertisers,
developers and publishers, or our ability to further improve such
tools;

• government actions or legislative, regulatory, or other legal
developments relating to AI or advertising, including developments
that may impact our ability to deliver, target, or measure the
effectiveness of advertising;

• changes that limit our ability to deliver, target, or measure the
effectiveness of advertising, including changes to policies by
mobile operating system and third-party platform providers, and the
degree to which users opt in or opt out of certain types of ad
targeting as a result of changes and controls implemented in
connection with such policy changes and with the E.U. General Data
Protection Regulation (the "GDPR"), ePrivacy Directive, the
California Consumer Privacy Act (the "CCPA") as amended by the
California Privacy Rights Act (the "CPRA"), similar U.S. privacy
laws in other states, and the Children’s Online Privacy Protection
Act (the "COPPA");

• decisions by clients to reduce their advertising due to concerns
about legal liability or uncertainty regarding their own legal and
compliance obligations, or due to negative publicity, regardless of
its accuracy, involving us, our user data practices, advertising
metrics or tools, our advertising solutions, or other companies in
our industry; and

• the impact of macroeconomic conditions, including tariffs, trade
wars, inflation, and high interest rates, political uncertainty and
international conflicts around the world, such as in Ukraine and
the Middle East, as well as friction between the United States and
China, and responses thereto, and seasonality, whether in the
advertising industry in general, or among specific types of
advertisers or within particular geographies.

From time to time, certain of these factors have adversely affected
our revenue to varying degrees. The occurrence of any of these or
other factors in the future could result in a reduction in demand
for our advertising solutions, which may reduce the prices we
receive for our advertisements or cause clients to stop advertising
with us altogether, either of which would adversely affect our
business and results of operations. The failure to attract new
clients, loss of clients, or reduction in spending by clients could
adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.

The advertising ecosystem is intensely competitive. If clients or
users prefer our competitors’ products or services over our own,
our business, financial condition, and results of operations could
be adversely affected.

We face significant competition in the advertising ecosystem. We
collect revenue from clients for fees paid by advertisers,
including developers, that use our advertising solutions.
Advertisers often engage with several advertising platforms and
networks to purchase advertisements and developers often engage
with multiple tools to market and monetize their apps. Accordingly,
we face significant competition from traditional, online, and
mobile businesses that provide ad networks and platforms and other
services for advertisers to reach relevant audiences. We also face
competition from providers of developer tools that enable
developers to reach their audiences or manage or optimize their
advertising campaigns. These companies vary in size and include
Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Unity Software as well as various
private companies, several of which are also our partners and
clients. Clients who are also competitors may decide to invest in
their own offerings rather than continue to use our advertising
solutions.

We also face competition for advertising spending and for the
discretionary spending, leisure time, and attention of users from
game platforms such as personal computer and console games, and
other leisure time activities, such as television, movies, music,
sports, and the internet. During periods of macroeconomic
uncertainty, levels of advertising and discretionary spending have
historically decreased and are likely to decrease and therefore
this competition may intensify, which has at times harmed and may
in the future harm our revenue. To the extent we explore entering
into new markets or new business opportunities in the advertising
ecosystem or otherwise, we may also compete with established
businesses with more experience in such areas. Some of our current
and potential
                                42

competitors may be domiciled in different countries and subject to
political, legal, and regulatory regimes that enable them to
compete more effectively than us, particularly outside of the
United States. Some of our current and potential competitors may
have greater resources, more diversified revenue streams, better
technological or data analytics capabilities, or stronger brands or
competitive positions in certain product segments, geographic
regions, or user demographics than we do. If clients prefer our
competitors’ products or services over our own, or if our
competitors are better able to adapt to changes in the preferences
of advertisers or users, regulations, or other developments, our
business, financial condition, and results of operations could be
adversely affected.

The advertising ecosystem is subject to rapid technological change,
and if we do not adapt to, and appropriately allocate our resources
among, emerging technologies and business models, our business,
financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely
affected.

Technology changes rapidly in the advertising ecosystem. Our future
success depends in part on our ability to adapt to trends and to
innovate. To attract new clients and users and increase revenue
from our current clients, we may develop new products or enter into
new markets and we will need to enhance and improve our advertising
solutions. For example, in October 2025 we opened a public referral
program to onboard customers to Axon Ads Manager, which we expect
to launch more broadly in the first half of 2026. Our ability to
improve the effectiveness and predictability of our advertising
recommendations through improvements to Axon AI, our advertising
recommendation engine, is critical to our continuing success and
future growth. Enhancements of our existing technology and
offerings, and new offerings, may not be introduced in a timely or
cost-effective manner and may contain errors or defects, both of
which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and
results of operations.

Our business also currently depends in part on the growth and
evolution of the internet, especially mobile internet-enabled
devices. The number of people using mobile internet-enabled devices
has increased rapidly over time, and we expect that this trend will
continue. However, the markets in which we operate may not grow in
the way we anticipate. We must continually anticipate and adapt to
emerging technologies to stay competitive, including the
development of AI and its impacts on the advertising ecosystem. As
the technological infrastructure for internet access improves and
evolves, consumers will be presented with more opportunities to
access apps and play games on a variety of devices and platforms
and to experience other leisure activities that may compete with
mobile apps. Forecasting the financial impact of these emerging
technologies and business models is inherently uncertain and
volatile. If we decide to support a new technology or business
model in the future, it may require partnering with a new platform,
technology, or business partner, which may be on terms that are
less favorable to us than those for traditional technologies or
business models.

To invest in a new technology, enter a new market or expand our
offerings, we must invest financial resources and management
attention. We may invest significant resources in a new offering,
entering a new market or in a strategic acquisition or partnership,
which could prove unsuccessful or prevent us from directing these
resources towards other opportunities. We may never recover the
often-substantial up-front costs of developing and marketing
emerging technologies or business models, or recover the
opportunity cost of diverting management and financial resources.
Further, our competitors may adopt an emerging technology or
business model more quickly or effectively than we do, creating
products that are technologically superior to ours or attract more
users than ours.

If, on the other hand, we do not continue to enhance our
advertising solutions, or do not appropriately allocate our
resources amongst opportunities, or we otherwise elect not to
pursue new business models that achieve significant commercial
success, we may face adverse consequences. It may take significant
time and expenditures to shift product development resources to new
technologies, and it may be more difficult to compete against
existing products incorporating such technologies. If new
technologies render mobile devices obsolete or we are unable to
successfully adapt to and appropriately allocate our resources
amongst current and new technologies, our business, financial
condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Our advertising solutions, as well as our internal systems, rely on
software and hardware that is highly technical, and any errors,
bugs, or vulnerabilities in these systems, or failures to address
or mitigate technical limitations in our systems, could adversely
affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.

Our advertising solutions, as well as our internal systems, rely on
software and hardware, including AI technologies, that are highly
technical and complex. In addition, our advertising solutions, as
well as our internal systems, depend in part on the ability of such
software and hardware to store, retrieve, process, and manage
immense amounts of data. The software and hardware on which we rely
has contained, and will in the future contain, errors, bugs, or
vulnerabilities and our systems are subject to certain technical
limitations that may compromise our ability to meet our objectives.
Some errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities inherently may be difficult
to
                                43                                 
Table of Contents
detect and may only be discovered after the code has been released
for external or internal use. Errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, design
defects, or technical limitations within the software and hardware
on which we rely have in the past led to, and may in the future
lead to, outcomes including a negative experience for clients and
users who use our offerings, compromised ability of our offerings
to perform in a manner consistent with our terms, contracts, or
policies, delayed product launches or enhancements, targeting,
measurement, or billing errors, compromised ability to protect data
and/or our intellectual property, or reductions in our ability to
provide some or all of our services. To the extent such errors,
bugs, vulnerabilities, or defects impact our advertising solutions
or the accuracy of data in the advertising solutions, our clients
may become dissatisfied with our offerings, our brand and
reputation may be harmed, and we may make operational decisions
that are based on inaccurate data. Any errors, bugs,
vulnerabilities, or defects in our systems or the software and
hardware on which we rely, failures to properly address or mitigate
the technical limitations in our systems, or associated
degradations or interruptions of service or failures to fulfill our
commitments to our clients may lead to outcomes including damage to
our reputation, increased product engineering expenses, regulatory
inquiries, litigation, or liability for fines, damages, or other
remedies, any of which could adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.

Our business depends in part on our ability to maintain and scale
our technical infrastructure, and any significant disruption to our
advertising solutions could damage our reputation, result in a
potential loss of engagement, and adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.

Our reputation and ability to attract and retain our clients and
users depends in part on the reliable performance of our
advertising solutions. We have in the past experienced, and may in
the future experience, interruptions in the availability or
performance of our offerings from time to time. Our systems may not
be adequately designed or may not operate with the reliability and
redundancy necessary to avoid performance delays or outages that
could be harmful to our business. If our offerings are unavailable
when users attempt to access them, or if they do not load as
quickly as expected, users may not use our offerings as often in
the future, or at all, which could adversely affect our business
and results of operations. As we continue to grow, we will need an
increasing amount of technical infrastructure, including network
capacity and computing power, to continue to satisfy our needs and
the needs of our clients. Additionally, we rely on certain third-
party providers for our increasing network capacity and computing
power needs, and if we fail to properly anticipate our needs or
secure sufficient capacity at a reasonable cost, our ability to
scale and grow our business, or our profitability, could be
negatively impacted. Our business may be subject to interruptions,
delays, or failures resulting from natural disasters and other
events outside of our control that impact us or these third-party
providers. If such an event were to occur, users may be subject to
service disruptions or outages and we may not be able to recover
our technical infrastructure and user data in a timely manner to
restart or provide our services. If we fail to efficiently scale
and manage our infrastructure, or if events disrupt our
infrastructure or those of our third-party providers, our business,
financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely
affected.

Our revenue has been concentrated in the mobile app ecosystem and
any failure to successfully expand and diversify our revenue
sources beyond the mobile ecosystem could adversely affect our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We face concentration risk in that our advertising solutions
primarily operate in the mobile app ecosystem and specifically
mobile gaming. As such, our business depends, in part, on the
continued health and growth of these app ecosystems. Further, a
significant amount of our total revenue is derived through a
limited number of third-party distribution platforms, such as the
Apple App Store, the Google Play Store, and Facebook. Because
Facebook and Google are also significant partners of Adjust, a
deterioration in our or Adjust’s relationship with such companies
would have a greater impact on our business, financial condition,
and results of operations. If any of these concentrated portions of
our revenue are harmed or are lost, our business, financial
condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Our future growth may involve expansion into new business
opportunities, and any efforts to do so that are unsuccessful or
are not cost-effective could adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.

In the past, we have grown by expanding our offerings into new
business opportunities and we expect to continue to do so. We have
dedicated resources to expanding into adjacent business
opportunities in which large competitors have an established
presence, such as e-commerce. For example, in October 2025 we
opened a public referral program to onboard customers to Axon Ads
Manager, which we expect to launch more broadly in the first half
of 2026. Additionally, our future growth may include expansion into
additional features for our advertisers and publishers, other
mobile app sectors, social, connected TV markets through Wurl, or
other opportunities which may require significant investment in
order to launch and which may not prove successful. Further, any
such expansion
                                44                                 
Table of Contents
may subject us to new or additional laws and regulations,
compliance with which may be burdensome and costly. Our future
growth depends in part on our ability to correctly identify areas
of investment and to cost-effectively execute on our plans. For
example, we generate revenue through our Wurl CTV business which
provides streaming content distribution and advertising services.
The market for CTV platforms is relatively new and evolving and
this market may develop slower or differently than we expect. There
can be no assurance that we will achieve broader adoption among
e-commerce advertisers or that we will effectively develop
technology for our advertising solutions that will allow us to
successfully expand into new markets.

We have in the past and may in the future expend significant
resources in connection with strategic acquisitions and
partnerships to expand into new business opportunities. Even if
successful, the growth of any new business opportunity could create
significant challenges for our management and operational resources
and could require considerable investment. The deployment of
significant resources towards a new opportunity that proves
unsuccessful, or our inability to choose the correct investment
opportunities for our future, could adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.

Our business is subject to global economic, market, public health,
and geopolitical conditions as well as to natural disasters beyond
our control and could adversely affect our revenue and results of
operations.

General macroeconomic conditions, such as inflation, high interest
rates, or a recession or economic slowdown in the United States or
internationally, including those resulting from tariffs, trade
wars, political uncertainty and international conflicts around the
world, such as between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East,
as well as friction between the United States and China, could
create uncertainty and adversely affect discretionary consumer
spending habits and preferences as well as advertising spending. In
addition, changes in macroeconomic conditions, including those due
to recent actual and proposed tariff increases imposed by the
United States on various trading partners, could change consumer
behavior and adversely affect advertising spending and costs
related to our operations. Specifically, the U.S. has imposed
significant new and escalated tariffs on products from China since
February 2025, significant new tariffs on many products of Canada
and Mexico since March 2025, and a global tariff on most products
from almost all other U.S. trading partners since April 2025; these
policies have been fluid and the full economic impact of these
policies is currently uncertain. Our revenue is driven in part by
discretionary consumer spending habits and preferences, and by
advertising spending patterns. Historically, consumer purchasing
and advertising spending have each declined during economic
downturns and periods of uncertainty regarding future economic
prospects or when disposable income or consumer lending is lower.
In certain periods in 2022, we experienced the impacts of the
macroeconomic deterioration as advertisers more closely managed
budgets and reduced overall spend, which resulted in slowed growth
for our advertising solutions. Uncertain economic conditions may
impact advertiser spending in future periods and may also adversely
affect our clients, which in turn may harm our business, financial
condition, and results of operations. In addition, the economic
conditions affecting the financial markets, and uncertainty in
global economic conditions may result in a number of adverse
effects including a low level of liquidity in domestic and global
markets, volatility in credit, equity, and currencies and
instability in the stock market. There could be a number of other
follow-on effects from these economic developments on our business,
including customer insolvencies, decreased demand for our
advertising solutions; decreased customer ability to pay their
accounts, and increased collections risk and defaults. We are
particularly susceptible to market conditions and risks associated
with the advertising ecosystem, including changes in user
demographics, the availability and popularity of other forms of
entertainment, and critical reviews and public tastes and
preferences, which may change rapidly and cannot necessarily be
predicted.

Our business is subject to economic, market, public health, and
geopolitical conditions, as well as natural disasters beyond our
control. For example, we have employees located in Israel and as a
result of the international conflict in the Middle East, we have
incurred and are likely to continue to incur costs to support our
employees and address related challenges. In addition, our
management has spent time and attention on these and related events
and will continue to monitor and assess the ongoing disruptions to
our team members, our management, and our operations, each of which
could potentially harm our business. We may also experience
interruptions or delays in the services they provide to us as a
result of such geopolitical volatilities.

Further, we have operations in China and the continuing tension
between the U.S. and China may impact our business and results of
operations in the future. The U.S. government has restricted the
ability to send certain products and technology to China without an
export license. In many cases, these licenses are subject to a
policy of denial and will not be issued. While our current products
are not restricted by these controls, such controls or future
restrictions could impact our business in the future. Additionally,
the U.S. government also continues to add additional entities in
China and other countries to restricted party lists impacting the
ability of U.S. companies to engage with these entities. In
addition, the Chinese government has retaliated, and may continue
to retaliate, to recent changes in U.S. tariffs and export controls
in ways that could indirectly impact our business.
                                45

While not currently material to the operation of our business,
management and our board of directors have discussed and assessed,
and will continue to discuss and assess, any risks related to
international conflicts around the world, such as in Ukraine and
the Middle East, as well as tension between the United States and
China, including but not limited to, risks related to
cybersecurity, sanctions, regulatory changes, and personnel based
in affected regions to ensure we are prepared to react to new
developments or further sanctions as they arise. If we are unable
to promptly or properly react to new developments in these and
other international regions, our business, financial condition, and
results of operations could be adversely affected.

Our principal offices are located in Palo Alto, an area known for
earthquakes and susceptible to fires, and are thus vulnerable to
damage. All of our facilities are also vulnerable to damage from
natural or manmade disasters, including power loss, earthquakes,
fires, explosions, floods, communications failures, terrorist
attacks, contagious disease outbreak (such as the COVID-19
pandemic), and similar events. If any disaster were to occur, our
ability to operate our business at our facilities could be impaired
and we could incur significant losses, recovery from which may
require substantial time and expense.

We plan to continue to consider opportunities to expand and
diversify our operations through strategic acquisitions and
partnerships, and we provided an indication of interest to the
President of the United States to explore a purchase of TikTok in
all markets outside of China. We face a number of risks related to
strategic transactions we may pursue.

We will continue to consider opportunities to expand and diversify
our operations with additional strategic acquisitions or
partnerships, strategic collaborations, joint ventures, or
licensing arrangements. As we continue to grow, these transactions
may be larger and require significant investments, such as our
acquisitions of Adjust, the MoPub business, and Wurl.

In April 2025, we confirmed that we had provided an indication of
interest to the President of the United States to explore a
purchase of TikTok in all markets outside of China. This indication
of interest is preliminary and there can be no assurance that a
transaction involving us will proceed. If our proposal to combine
with TikTok does not result in a definitive agreement, this may be
viewed negatively by investors, securities analysts, customers and
other strategic partners and our stock price could decline. Whether
or not we enter into a definitive agreement to combine with TikTok,
the announcement and pendency of the proposal, the market reaction
to our proposal and related discussions regarding our proposed
combination with TikTok could cause disruptions in our business.
For example, significant management attention may be directed
toward discussions and processes related to a potential business
combination, which could adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations. Even if we have an opportunity
to enter into a business combination transaction with TikTok, the
consummation of that transaction may be subject to various closing
conditions and either party may be unable to satisfy one or more of
the closing conditions. Further, the exploration of a possible
transaction with TikTok could result in us incurring significant
costs, expenses and fees, including for professional services and
other transaction costs, for which we will have received little or
no benefit, should no such transaction take place, and that may be
viewed negatively or impact our financial results which could have
a negative impact on our stock.

We may be unable to identify or complete prospective acquisitions
or partnerships for many reasons, including our ability to identify
suitable targets, increasing competition from other potential
acquirers, the effects of consolidation in our industries,
potentially high valuations of acquisition candidates, and the
availability of financing to complete larger acquisitions. Even if
we do complete any such transactions, we may incur significant
costs, such as professional service fees or publisher bonuses.
Further, completing larger acquisitions or other strategic
transactions can involve significantly more risk in that such
transactions involve complicated integrations and require
significant management attention to complete, and these large
strategic transactions could introduce additional exposure to
regulatory and compliance risk. In addition, applicable antitrust
laws and other regulations may limit our ability to acquire
targets, particularly larger targets, or force us to divest an
acquired business. If we are unable to identify suitable targets or
complete acquisitions, or if such acquisitions lead to heightened
regulatory or compliance risk, our growth prospects could be
adversely affected, and we may not be able to realize sufficient
scale and technological advantages to compete effectively in all
markets.

To complete large strategic transactions, we may need to spend
significant amounts of cash, which may not be available to us on
acceptable terms, if at all, or which could lead us to incur
additional debt (and increased interest expense), assume contingent
liabilities or amortization expenses related to intangible assets,
or write-offs of goodwill and intangible assets. In addition, we
may need to issue significant amounts of equity or equity-linked
consideration, which would dilute our current stockholders’
ownership and could adversely affect the price of our Class A
common stock. For example, we have expressed an interest in
purchasing TikTok in all markets outside of China, and such a
transaction, if it were to take place, would likely require the
issuance of a significant amount of
                                46                                 
Table of Contents
equity. Further, we generally devote more time and resources
towards performing diligence on larger transactions and may be
required to devote more resources towards regulatory requirements
in connection with such transactions. To the extent that we do not
perform sufficient diligence on a larger acquisition or such a
transaction does not generate the expected benefits, our business,
financial condition, and results of operations will be harmed, and
to a greater extent than would occur with a smaller transaction.

Absent such strategic transactions, we would need to undertake
additional development or commercialization activities at our own
expense. If we elect to fund and undertake such additional efforts
on our own, we may need to obtain additional expertise and
additional capital, which may not be available to our company on
acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to do any of the
foregoing, we may not be able to develop our advertising solutions
effectively or achieve our expected product roadmap on a timely
basis, which could adversely affect our business, financial
condition, and results of operations.

The benefits of a strategic acquisition or partnership may also
take considerable time to develop, and we cannot be certain that
any particular strategic acquisition or partnership will produce
the intended benefits. If we are unable to identify and complete
strategic acquisitions or partnerships or realize the anticipated
benefits from such transactions, our business, financial condition,
and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Our international operations are subject to increased challenges
and risks.

We expect to continue to expand our international operations in the
future. Our resources are located throughout the world, including
in areas with less certain legal and regulatory regimes or more
potential risks. Expanding our international operations may subject
us to risks associated with:

• recruiting and retaining talented and capable management and
employees in foreign countries;

• challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural
differences;

• increased risk of loss, data breaches or cybersecurity attacks
from our global operations;

• developing and customizing advertising solutions that appeal to
the tastes and preferences of users in international markets;

• the inability to offer certain advertising solutions in certain
foreign countries;

• competitors with intellectual property rights and significant
market share in those markets and with a better understanding of
user preferences;

• utilizing, protecting, defending, and enforcing our intellectual
property rights;

• the inability to extend proprietary rights in our brand, content,
or technology into new jurisdictions;

• compliance with applicable foreign laws and regulations,
including anti-bribery laws, privacy and data protection laws, AI
laws, economic and trade sanctions, and laws relating to content
and consumer protection;

• credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud;

• currency exchange rate fluctuations;

• protectionist laws and business practices that favor local
businesses in certain countries;

• double taxation of our international earnings and potentially
adverse tax consequences due to changes in the tax laws in the
United States or the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate;

• political, economic, and social instability, including impacts
related to labor, supply chain disruptions, inflation, and as a
result of war, terrorism, or armed conflict, including
international conflicts around the world, such as between Russia
and Ukraine and in the Middle East, as well as, increasing friction
between the United States and China and the impacts on their
respective regions and the regional and global economy;

• public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which can
result in varying impacts to our employees, clients, users,
advertisers, app developers, and business partners internationally;

• higher costs associated with doing business internationally,
including costs related to local advisors;

• export or import regulations; and

• trade and tariff restrictions.
                                47

Our ability to successfully gain market acceptance in any
particular international market is uncertain and, in the past, we
have experienced difficulties and have not been successful in all
the countries we have entered. If we are unable to continue to
expand internationally or manage the complexity of our global
operations successfully, our business, financial condition, and
results of operations could be adversely affected.

We face risks related to our strategic transactions, which may not
achieve our strategic objectives, may disrupt our operations or
result in unexpected liabilities or expenses.

As part of our growth strategy, we have frequently acquired
companies, businesses, personnel, and technologies, and we intend
to continue to evaluate and pursue strategic transactions. For
example, we acquired Adjust GmbH in April 2021, Twitter's MoPub
business in January 2022 and Wurl, Inc. in April 2022. Each
acquisition requires unique approaches to integration due to, among
other reasons, the structure of the acquisition, the size,
locations, and cultural differences among their team and ours, and
has required, and will continue to require, attention from our
management team. As we continue to grow, the size of our
acquisitions and investments has increased and may continue to
increase. In addition to the larger purchase prices associated with
such acquisitions and investments, larger acquisitions and
investments may also require additional management resources to
integrate more significant and often more complex businesses into
our company. We will continue to explore and evaluate additional
acquisitions, some of which may be the same size or even larger in
scale and investment than our recent acquisitions.

Our future success depends in part on our ability to integrate
these acquisitions and manage these businesses, partnerships, and
transactions effectively. If we are unable to obtain the
anticipated benefits or synergies of such acquisitions, or we
encounter difficulties integrating acquired businesses with ours,
our business, financial condition, and results of operations could
be adversely affected.

Challenges and risks from such strategic transactions include:

• diversion of our management’s attention in the acquisition and
integration process, including oversight over acquired businesses
which continue their operations under contingent consideration
provisions in acquisition agreements;

• declining employee morale and retention issues resulting from
changes in compensation or benefits, or changes in management,
reporting relationships, or future performance;

• the need to integrate the operations, systems, technologies,
products, and personnel of each acquired company, the
inefficiencies and lack of control that may result if such
integration is delayed or not implemented, and unforeseen
difficulties and expenditures that may arise in connection with
integration;

• costs associated with onboarding clients of an acquired business;

• the need to implement internal controls, procedures, and policies
appropriate for a larger, U.S.-based public company at companies
that prior to acquisition may not have as robust controls,
procedures, and policies, in particular, with respect to the
effectiveness of internal controls, cyber and information security
practices and incident response plans, compliance with privacy,
data protection, and other regulations protecting the rights of
clients and users, and compliance with U.S.-based economic policies
and sanctions which may not have previously been applicable to the
acquired company’s operations;

• the difficulty in accurately forecasting and accounting for the
financial impact of an acquisition transaction, including
accounting charges, write-offs of deferred revenue under purchase
accounting, and integrating and reporting results for acquired
companies that have not historically followed GAAP;

• the implementation of restructuring actions and cost reduction
initiatives to streamline operations and improve cost efficiencies;

• the fact that we may be required to pay contingent consideration
in excess of the initial fair value, and contingent consideration
may become payable at a time when we do not have sufficient cash
available to pay such consideration;

• in the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate
operations across different cultures and languages and to address
the particular economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks
associated with specific countries as well as tax risks that may
arise from the acquisition;

• increasing legal, regulatory, and compliance exposure, and the
additional costs related to mitigate each of those, as a result of
adding new offices, employees and other service providers, benefit
plans, equity, job types, and lines of business globally; and
                                48                                 
Table of Contents
• liability for activities of the acquired company before the
acquisition, including intellectual property, commercial, and other
litigation claims or disputes, security vulnerabilities, violations
of laws, rules and regulations, including with respect to employee
classification, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown
liabilities.

If we are unable to successfully integrate and manage our strategic
transactions, we may not realize the expected benefits of such
transactions or become exposed to additional liabilities, and our
business, financial condition, and results of operations could be
adversely affected.

In addition, we have in the past, and may in the future, also
choose to divest certain businesses or product lines. For example,
in June 2025, we sold our Apps Business. As a result of this
divestiture, we will no longer generate Apps revenue and we may not
achieve the desired strategic and financial benefits. Any future
divestitures or similar transactions may, among other risks, result
in reduced revenue, cause us to incur additional expenses, disrupt
third party or employee relationships, and expose us to
unanticipated or ongoing obligations and liabilities, including as
a result of our indemnification obligations or any agreement to
provide transition services.

Our strategic transactions may expose us to tax risks.

From time to time, we have acquired and may acquire companies,
assets, businesses, and technologies and we have entered into and
may enter into other strategic partnerships and transactions. We
face a variety of tax risks related to such transactions, including
that we may be required to make tax withholdings in various
jurisdictions in connection with such transactions or as part of
our continuing operations following a transaction, and that the
companies or businesses we acquire may cause us to alter our
international tax structure or otherwise create more complexity
with respect to tax matters. Additionally, while we typically
include indemnification provisions in our definitive agreements
related to strategic acquisitions and partnerships, these
indemnification provisions may be insufficient in the event that
tax liabilities are greater than expected or in areas that are not
fully covered by indemnification. If we are unable to adequately
predict and address such tax issues as they arise, our business,
financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely
affected.

We have experienced recent rapid growth, which may not be
indicative of our future growth. We may be unable to effectively
manage the growth of our business, which could adversely affect our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We have experienced rapid growth in the scale, scope, and
complexity of our business. For example, our revenue has expanded
rapidly, in particular since the launch of Axon AI, our advertising
recommendation engine. Our growth in any prior period should not be
relied upon as an indication of our future performance, as we may
not be able to sustain our growth rate in the future. Even if our
revenue continues to increase, we expect that our revenue growth
rate may decline in the future as a result of a variety of factors,
including because of more difficult comparisons to prior periods
and the saturation of the market. The overall growth of our revenue
depends in part on our ability to execute on our growth strategies.
As we implement additional strategies designed to increase revenue,
such as investing in product development, new initiatives, or
strategic transactions, we are likely to recognize costs associated
with these investments earlier than some of the expected benefits,
and the return on these investments may be lower, or may develop
more slowly, than we expect. If we are unable to generate adequate
revenue growth and manage our expenses, our margins and
profitability may be harmed.

Additionally, the growth and expansion of our business has placed
and continues to place a significant strain on our management,
operations, financial infrastructure, and corporate culture. Our
future success depends in part on our ability to manage this
expanded business. If not managed effectively, this growth could
result in the over-extension of our management systems and
information technology systems and our internal controls and
procedures may not be adequate to support this growth. Failure to
adequately manage our growth in any of these ways may cause damage
to our brand and reputation and adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.
We generally do not have long-term agreements with our clients.
Our clients are not required to enter into long-term agreements
with us and may choose to stop using our advertising solutions at
any time. In order to continue to grow our advertising solutions,
we must consistently provide offerings that clients see as valuable
and choose to use. If we fail to maintain our relationships with
our clients, or if the terms of these relationships become less
favorable to us, our results of operations would be harmed.
Additionally, as certain of our clients are also our competitors,
these clients may choose to invest in their own offerings rather
than continue to use our advertising solutions. Any failure to
maintain our relationships with clients could adversely affect our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.

If we do not successfully or cost-effectively invest in and
maintain awareness of our brands, our business, financial
condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.

We believe that investing in and maintaining our brands is critical
to maintaining and creating favorable relationships with, and our
ability to attract, new clients, and key personnel. In connection
with 2025 launch of our self-serve advertising platform (Axon Ads
Manager), we publicly launched our Axon product branding.
Increasing awareness of the AppLovin corporate brand and of Axon
specifically will depend largely upon our marketing efforts and our
ability to successfully differentiate our advertising solutions
from the offerings of our competitors. In addition, successfully
globalizing and extending our brands requires significant
investment and extensive management time. If we fail to maintain
and increase brand awareness and recognition of our advertising
solutions, our business, financial condition, and results of
operations could be adversely affected.

Third parties with whom we do business may be unable to honor their
obligations to us or their actions may put us at risk.

We rely on third parties for various aspects of our business,
including demand-side platforms, agencies, advertising partners,
and publishers who use our advertising solutions. Their actions may
violate our contracts, policies, and applicable laws and
regulations, or may otherwise put our business and reputation at
risk. Demand-side platforms may be given access to personal
information in order to bid on advertising inventory, and they may
misappropriate and engage in unauthorized use of our information,
technology, or customers' data. In violation of our policies,
advertisers may enable the serving of ads that contain prohibited,
restricted, or inappropriate content, or content that otherwise
fails to adhere to country-specific laws, rules, or regulations. We
also work with advertisers that operate sports gambling apps, apps
that involve real money gambling, and apps in other regulated
industries and markets, each of which imposes additional regulatory
requirements on these advertisers, which they may not comply with.
A vast amount of publishers attempt to use our advertising
solutions, a number of which may attempt to monetize prohibited,
restricted, or inappropriate content, or may engage or attempt to
engage in fraudulent or other unlawful activity in violation of our
policies, which in turn imposes additional operational costs to
protect our platform, may trigger additional law enforcement or
other inquiries, may put our reputation at risk, and may otherwise
adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.

The failure of these third parties to provide or maintain adequate
services and technologies could result in a disruption to our
business operations. Further, disruptions in the mobile application
industry or financial markets, economic downturns, and poor
business decisions may adversely affect our partners and may
increase their propensity to engage in fraud or other unlawful
activity which could harm our business or reputation, and they may
not be able to honor their obligations to us, or we may cease our
arrangements with them.
                                                                   
  Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters                    
                                                                   
We are subject to laws and regulations concerning privacy,
information security, data protection, consumer protection,
advertising, tracking, targeting, and protection of minors, and
these laws and regulations are continually evolving. Our actual or
perceived failure to comply with these laws and regulations could
adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.

We receive, store, and process personal information and other data,
including data relating to individuals and households, and we
enable our users to share their personal information with each
other and with third parties. Numerous federal, state, and local
laws around the world address privacy and the collection, storing,
sharing, use, disclosure, deletion, protection, and other
processing of personal information and other data, including data
relating to individuals and households, the scope of which are
changing, subject to differing interpretations, and may be
inconsistent between jurisdictions or conflict with other
obligations.

Various government and consumer agencies have called for, or sought
to implement, new regulation and changes in industry practices
relating to the collection and processing of information concerning
consumer behavior, including by restricting certain targeted
advertising practices. For example, the GDPR, which became
effective in May 2018, created new individual privacy rights and
imposed worldwide obligations on companies processing personal data
of European Union ("EU") users, which has created a greater
compliance burden for us and other companies with European users,
and subjects violators to substantial monetary penalties. For
example, the GDPR and other similar regulations require companies
to give specific types of notice and in some cases seek consent
from data subjects to collect and use their data for certain
purposes, including interest-based advertising. The United Kingdom
has implemented legislation that substantially implements the GDPR
and which also provides for substantial monetary penalties. In June
2021, the European Commission announced a decision of “adequacy”
concluding that the United Kingdom ensures an equivalent level of
data protection to the GDPR, which generally permits personal data
flows from the European Economic Area ("EEA") to the United
Kingdom. Such adequacy decision must, however, be renewed in 2025
and may be modified or revoked in the interim. In June 2025, the
                                50

United Kingdom enacted targeted modifications to its data
protection framework that cause it to deviate from the GDPR in
certain respects. The European Commission has proposed to renew the
United Kingdom’s adequacy decision after assessing the United
Kingdom’s modifications to its data protection framework, but
additional procedural steps remain, causing some uncertainty to
remain with respect to this adequacy decision. We cannot fully
predict how United Kingdom data protection laws or regulations may
develop in the medium to longer term, nor the impacts of divergent
laws and guidance regarding EU and United Kingdom data protection
law.

With regard to transfers to the United States of personal data from
our employees and European users and other third parties, we
historically relied upon the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield
programs as well as standard contractual clauses approved by the EU
Commission (the "SCCs"); however, the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and
the SCCs have been subject to legal challenge, and on July 16,
2020, the Court of Justice of the EU held in the Schrems II case
that the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield was invalid, and imposed
obligations in connection with use of the SCCs. EU regulators also
have issued guidance that we and other companies must consider and
undertake when using the SCCs. On June 4, 2021, the European
Commission adopted new SCCs to reflect GDPR requirements. The
United Kingdom’s Information Commissioner’s Office also has issued
new standard contractual clauses for which implementation is
required. Further, the Austrian, French, Italian, and Danish data
protection authorities have indicated that use of Google Analytics
by European website operators involves the unlawful transfer of
personal data to the United States. In March 2022, the EU and U.S.
agreed in principle upon a new EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework
(“EU-U.S. DPF”). On July 10, 2023, the European Commission adopted
an adequacy decision in relation to the EU-U.S. DPF, allowing it to
be used to legitimize EU-U.S. personal data transfers for
participating entities. The United Kingdom and U.S. also have
established a UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF (the “UK Extension”),
effective October 12, 2023, whereby entities participating in the
EU-U.S. DPF, may rely upon the UK Extension to legitimize United
Kingdom-U.S. personal data transfers. Further, on July 17, 2023,
the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“Swiss-U.S. DPF”), which
provides for a means of legitimizing personal data transfers from
Switzerland to the U.S., entered into effect. We are self-certified
under the EU-U.S. DPF, Swiss-U.S. DPF, and the UK Extension. The
EU-U.S. DPF has faced legal challenge, and it and the Swiss-U.S.
DPF and UK Extension may be subject to further legal challenges.
The European Commission’s adequacy decision regarding the EU-U.S.
DPF provides that the EU-U.S. DPF will be subject to future reviews
and may be subject to suspension, amendment, repeal, or limitations
to its scope by the European Commission. The SCCs and other cross-
border data transfer mechanisms may also be the subject of
additional legislative activity and regulatory guidance. We and
many other companies may need to implement different or additional
measures to establish or maintain legitimate means for the transfer
and receipt of personal data from the EEA, Switzerland, the United
Kingdom, or other jurisdictions to the United States, and we may,
in addition to other impacts, experience additional costs
associated with increased compliance burdens, and we and our
clients face the potential for regulators to apply different
standards to the transfer of personal data from various
jurisdictions to the United States, and to block, or require ad hoc
verification of measures taken with respect to, certain data flows.
We also may find it necessary to engage in contract negotiations
with third parties that aid in processing data on our behalf, to
address cross-border data transfer matters. We may not be able to
find alternative service providers which could limit our ability to
process personal data from impacted jurisdictions and increase our
costs and/or impact our advertising solutions, or other offerings.
We and our clients may face a risk of enforcement actions by data
protection authorities relating to personal data transfers. Any
such enforcement actions could result in substantial costs and
diversion of resources, distract management and technical
personnel, and adversely affect our business, financial condition,
and results of operations. Similar to the GDPR, in September 2020,
Brazil enacted the Brazilian General Data Protection Law. China has
enacted a new data privacy law known as PIPL, effective November 1,
2021, which adopts a stringent data transfer regime requiring,
among other things, data subject consent for certain data
transfers. Any of these developments may have an adverse effect on
our business.

Moreover, there are increasing restrictions in the United States on
certain personal sensitive data transfers to certain foreign
countries. The Department of Justice finalized a final rule
implementing Executive Order 14117, effective April 8, 2025, which
prohibits data transfer of personal identifiers, precise
geolocation data, biometric identifiers, health data, and financial
data over a certain bulk threshold to identified countries of
concern (i.e., China, Hong Kong, Macau, Cuba, Iran, North Korea,
Russia, and Venezuela). The rule also restricts data brokerage
agreements, investment agreements, employment agreements, and
vendor agreements involving such data and countries of concern.
Violations of the rule may be punishable by criminal and/or civil
sanctions and may result in exclusion from participation in federal
and state programs. These data transfer restrictions may create
operational challenges and legal risks for our business,
particularly with regard to China, where we have operations.

Another example of increasingly stringent privacy legislation is
California’s passage of the CCPA, which went into effect on January
1, 2020, and created new privacy rights for residents, including a
private right of action for data breaches. The CPRA was approved by
California voters in November 2020, went into effect on January 1,
                                51                                 
Table of Contents
2023, and significantly modified the CCPA, resulting in further
uncertainty. Additionally, other states in the U.S. have proposed
or enacted laws addressing privacy and cybersecurity, many of which
are comprehensive statutes containing obligations similar to the
CCPA and CPRA, that have taken effect or will take effect in coming
years. Certain of these laws provide for private rights of action,
which may increase the likelihood of class action litigation, that
could also adversely affect our reputation, business, financial
condition, and results of operations. The U.S. federal government
is also contemplating federal privacy legislation. Our efforts to
comply with the CCPA, as modified by the CPRA, and other existing
and future legal requirements have required us and will continue to
require us to devote significant operational resources and incur
significant costs and expenses. Our compliance and oversight
efforts regarding privacy, data protection, and security will
require significant time and attention from our management and
board of directors.

Further, children’s privacy continues to be a focus of enforcement
activities and subjects our business to potential liability that
could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or
operating results. For example, enforcement of COPPA, which
requires companies to obtain parental consent before collecting
personal information from children known to be under the age of
thirteen or from child-directed websites or online services, has
increased in recent years, and the Federal Trade Commission has
finalized modifications to its rules implementing COPPA relating to
the use of children's data for targeted advertising that became
effective June 23, 2025, and for which compliance with most
provisions is required as of April 22, 2026. These modifications
may subject us to additional liability and require us to dedicate
additional compliance resources and modify certain policies and
practices. In addition, the GDPR prohibits certain processing of
the personal information of children under the age of thirteen to
sixteen (depending on jurisdiction) without parental consent where
consent is used as the lawful basis for processing that personal
information. The CCPA, as amended and supplemented by the CPRA,
requires companies to obtain the consent of children in California
under the age of sixteen (or parental consent for children under
the age of thirteen) before selling their personal information.
Several other states have enacted laws that would substantially
impact activities that involve showing targeted advertisements to
children. There also may be various laws, regulations, industry
standards, codes of conduct, or other actual or asserted
obligations relating to children’s privacy to which we may be, or
be asserted to be, subject, or that may otherwise impact our
business and operations. For example, the United Kingdom’s Age
Appropriate Design Code ("AADC") is one such regulatory framework
that has been adopted in the United Kingdom that focuses on online
safety and protection of children’s privacy online, and similar
frameworks are being considered in other jurisdictions. While our
terms of use prohibit publishers and advertisers from using our
services in connection with end users who qualify as a “child”
under applicable laws or content exclusively designed for or
exclusively directed to children under applicable laws and app
store policies, and we take reasonable efforts to comply with
applicable laws and regulations and certain other standards, we may
in the future face claims under COPPA, the GDPR, the CCPA, the
CPRA, or other laws, regulations, or other actual or asserted
obligations relating to children’s privacy.

Several states have enacted or proposed laws imposing new privacy
obligations related to health-related personal information beyond
traditional medical privacy laws like the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act. Washington’s My Health, My Data
Act, for example, broadly defines consumer health data and includes
a private right of action, raising potential litigation risks for
the advertising industry. A similar law in Virginia also allows
private enforcement. These developments may increase compliance
burdens, legal risks, and operational costs for us, our clients,
and others in the advertising technology ecosystem. We endeavor to
comply with applicable industry standards and are subject to the
terms of our privacy-related obligations and commitments to users
and third parties. We strive to comply with all applicable laws,
policies, legal obligations, and certain industry codes of conduct
relating to privacy and data protection, to the extent reasonably
attainable. However, it is possible that these or other actual or
asserted obligations relating to privacy, data protection, or
information security may be interpreted and applied in a manner
that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may
conflict with other rules or our practices. It is also possible
that laws, policies, legal obligations, or industry codes of
conduct may be implemented, modified, or interpreted in manners
that could prevent us from offering services to categories of
users, such as residents of a certain jurisdiction or may make it
costlier or more difficult for us to do so. Any failure or
perceived failure by us to comply with our terms of service or
privacy policy, or with applicable laws, regulations, or legal,
contractual, or other actual or asserted obligations to users or
third parties, concerning privacy, information security, data
protection, consumer protection, or protection of minors; or our
privacy-related legal obligations, or any compromise of security
that results, or is perceived to result, in the unauthorized
release or transfer of personal information or other user data, may
result in governmental enforcement actions or other proceedings,
claims, demands, and litigation by private parties, or public
statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and
could cause our users to lose trust in us, which could adversely
affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
Additionally, if third parties we work with, such as users,
developers, vendors, service providers, or other business partners
violate applicable laws or our policies, such violations may also
put our users’
                                52

information at risk and could in turn adversely affect our
reputation, business, financial condition, and results of
operations.

Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign laws, many
of which are unsettled and still developing, which could subject us
to claims or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial
condition, and results of operations.

We are subject to a variety of laws in the United States and
abroad, and it is possible that a number of laws and regulations
may be adopted or construed to apply to us in the United States and
elsewhere that could affect our business and restrict the
advertising ecosystem or development of our technologies, including
state and federal laws regarding antitrust, consumer protection,
electronic marketing, protection of minors, data protection, and
privacy, communications, content suitability, distribution,
competition, taxation, intellectual property, machine learning and
AI, money transmission, money laundering, investment screening,
sanctions, export, national security, and climate change, which are
continuously evolving and developing and any such policy and
regulatory changes could impose operational and compliance burdens.
The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be
applicable to us are often uncertain and evolving and may be
conflicting, particularly laws outside the United States. There is
a risk that existing or future laws may be interpreted in a manner
that is not consistent with our current practices and which could
adversely affect our business. As our advertising solutions grow
and evolve, including through the use of and integration of AI
technologies, and are used in a greater number of countries and on
a larger scale, we may also become subject to new laws and
regulations in additional jurisdictions or jurisdictions may claim
that we are required to comply with their laws and regulations. The
regulation of AI technologies is a relatively new and evolving area
of law which we may become subject to as we continue to explore the
use of AI technologies in our current and future products. For
example, in the EU, the EU Artificial Intelligence Act imposes a
regulatory framework for the companies' development and use of AI
systems, and numerous state laws in the U.S. have been proposed,
and in certain cases enacted, regulating aspects of the development
and use of AI systems. Beyond the EU and U.S., many other countries
have proposed AI-related legal frameworks. There is a risk that
existing or future laws may be interpreted in a manner that is not
consistent with our current practices and which could adversely
affect our business.

Furthermore, the growth and development of electronic commerce and
virtual goods may prompt calls for more stringent consumer
protection laws that may impose additional burdens on companies
such as ours conducting business through the internet and mobile
devices. We may also expand into new business opportunities that
subject us to additional laws and regulations. As such, we may be
required to seek licenses, authorizations, or approvals from
relevant regulators, the granting of which may be dependent on us
meeting certain capital and other requirements and we may be
subject to additional regulation and oversight, all of which could
significantly increase our operating costs. Changes in current laws
or regulations or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the
United States or elsewhere regarding these activities may lessen
the growth of the advertising ecosystem. Any costs incurred as a
result of adapting to laws and regulations, or as a result of
liability in connection therewith, could adversely affect our
business, financial condition, reputation and results of
operations.

The development and use of AI in our business, combined with an
uncertain regulatory environment, may adversely affect our
business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations.

We use AI technologies in connection with the development of our
advertising solutions, including Axon AI, our advertising
recommendation engine, and other product offerings, as well as in
other aspects of our business, and we will continue to invest in
the expansion of our AI capabilities, including possibly generative
AI. These technologies are complex and rapidly evolving, and the
development of AI technologies can require significant investment.
Expanding our AI capabilities subjects us to many of the risks
discussed elsewhere in this Risk Factors section, including risks
relating to rapid technological change, the highly technical nature
of software, and competition.

Additionally, the introduction of AI technologies into new or
existing products or other offerings may result in new or enhanced
governmental or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, confidentiality,
privacy, data protection, or security risks, social or ethical
concerns, or other complications that could adversely affect our
business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations.
The impact of AI technology on intellectual property ownership and
licensing rights, including copyright, has not been fully addressed
by U.S. courts or other federal or state laws or regulations, and
the use of third-party AI technologies in connection with our
products and services may result in exposure to claims of copyright
infringement or other intellectual property misappropriation. AI
technologies, including generative AI, may create content that is,
or is perceived to be, deficient, inaccurate, biased, offensive,
unethical, or otherwise flawed. Our customers or others may rely on
or use this content to their detriment, which may expose us to
brand or reputational harm, competitive harm, and/or legal
liability.

We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and similar
anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, and non-compliance with such
laws could subject us to criminal penalties or significant fines
and adversely affect our business and reputation.

We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the "FCPA"),
the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. § 201, the
U.S. Travel Act, and similar anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws
applicable in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Anti-
corruption and anti-bribery laws have been enforced aggressively in
recent years, are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies, their
employees, and third party business partners, representatives, and
agents from promising, authorizing, making or offering improper
payments or other benefits, directly or indirectly, to government
officials and others in the private sector in order to influence
official action, direct business to any person, gain any improper
advantage, or obtain or retain business. As we continue to expand
our business internationally, our risks under these laws increase.

We and our employees, third-party business partners,
representatives, and agents may have direct or indirect
interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or
state-owned or affiliated entities and we may be held liable for
the corrupt or other illegal activities of our employees, third-
party business partners, representatives, and agents, even if we do
not explicitly authorize such activities. These laws also require
that we keep accurate books and records and maintain internal
controls and compliance procedures designed to prevent any such
actions. While we have policies and procedures to address
compliance with such laws, we cannot assure you that our employees,
third-party business partners, representatives, and agents will not
take actions in violation of our policies or applicable law, for
which we may be ultimately held responsible and our exposure for
violating these laws increases as our international presence
expands and as we increase sales and operations in foreign
jurisdictions.

Any allegations or violations of the FCPA or other applicable anti-
corruption laws could result in whistleblower complaints, adverse
media coverage, investigations, loss of export privileges, severe
criminal or civil sanctions, suspension or disbarment from U.S.
government contracts, substantial diversion of management’s
attention, significant legal fees and fines, severe criminal or
civil sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees,
disgorgement of profits, other sanctions and remedial measures, and
prohibitions on the conduct of our business, any of which could
adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, and
results of operations. Responding to any investigation or action
will likely result in a significant diversion of management’s
attention and resources and significant defense costs and other
professional fees.

We are subject to governmental export controls and economic
sanctions laws that could impair our ability to compete in global
markets or subject us to liability if we violate the controls.

Our advertising solutions may be subject to U.S. export controls,
including the Export Administration Regulations. Under these
regulations, exports of our products and services as well as the
underlying technology may require export authorizations, including
by license, a license exception, or other appropriate government
authorizations, and the filing of a classification request or self-
classification report to use a license exception, as applicable.

Furthermore, our activities are subject to U.S. economic sanctions
laws and regulations administered by the U.S. Department of
Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control that prohibit
transactions with sanctioned parties, including the provision of
services and the export of hardware, software, and technology to
embargoed jurisdictions or sanctioned parties without the required
authorizations. These laws and regulations are rapidly evolving and
may be in conflict across international jurisdictions, leading to
uncertainty and difficulty in achieving full compliance. Should we
violate such existing or similar future laws or regulations, we may
be subject to substantial monetary fines or suffer reputational
damage and other penalties that could negatively impact our
business. If we need to obtain any necessary export licenses or
other authorizations for a particular sale, the process may be
time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of opportunities
to sell our products.

We take precautions to prevent our products and services and the
underlying technology from being provided, deployed or used in
violation of export control and sanctions laws and regulations,
including implementation of IP address blocking and sanctioned
person screening, and continue to evaluate and further enhance our
policies and procedures relating to export control and sanctions
compliance. However, we cannot assure you that our policies and
procedures relating to export control and sanctions compliance will
prevent violations in the future by us or our partners or agents.
If we are found to be in violation of sanctions or export control
regulations, including failure to obtain appropriate import,
export, or re-export licenses or permits, it can result in
significant penalties and government investigations, as well as
reputational harm and loss of business. Knowing and willful
violations can result in possible incarcerations for responsible
employees and managers.

In addition to the United States, various other countries regulate
the import and export of certain encryption
                                54

and other technology, including import and export licensing
requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to
distribute our products or could limit our clients’ ability to
implement our products in those countries. Changes in our
advertising solutions or future changes in export and import
regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products
and the underlying technology in international markets, prevent our
clients with global operations from deploying our products
globally, or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our
products to certain countries, governments, or persons altogether.
For example, the Chinese government has retaliated, and may
continue to retaliate, to recent changes in U.S. tariffs and export
controls in ways that could indirectly impact our business. If we
are unable to promptly or properly react to new developments in
these and other international regions, our business, financial
condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Our growth strategy includes further expanding our operations and
client base in international markets and acquiring companies that
may operate in countries where we do not already do business. Such
acquisitions may subject us to additional or expanded export and
sanctions regulations. Further, any change in export or import
regulations or controls, economic sanctions or related legislation,
or change in the countries, governments, persons, or technologies
targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our
products by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our
products to, existing or potential clients with global operations.
Any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to
export or sell our products in major international markets could
adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.

Changes in tax laws or tax rulings could adversely affect our
effective tax rates, business, financial condition, and results of
operations.

We are subject to tax laws, regulations, and rulings in the United
States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Changes in tax laws or
tax rulings, or changes in interpretations of existing laws, in the
tax regimes that we are subject to or operate under could cause us
to be subject to additional income-based taxes and non-income taxes
(such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, digital services, net
worth, property, and goods and services taxes), which in turn could
adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
For example, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the "IRA"),
enacted in August 2022, imposes a 15% minimum tax on global
adjusted financial statement income for tax years beginning after
December 31, 2022 for certain large companies. In addition, a
number of other countries and organizations, such as the
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, have enacted
changes to existing tax laws or new laws that could impact our tax
obligations, including a framework that imposes a 15% global
minimum tax, which has been implemented into the domestic laws of
some non-U.S. jurisdictions, and is being considered for
implementation by other countries. Additionally, the One Big
Beautiful Bill Act ("OBBBA"), enacted in July 2025, modifies
existing U.S. tax laws, including by permitting the deduction of
certain U.S. research and development expenditures and changing the
calculation and deductibility of certain provisions related to
international income for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Any
significant changes to our future effective tax rate could
adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.
We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.
Our tax obligations are based in part on our corporate operating
structure and intercompany arrangements, including the manner in
which we develop, value, manage, and use our intellectual property;
the valuation of our intercompany transactions; and our corporate
governance structure. The tax laws applicable to our business,
including the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions,
are subject to interpretation and certain jurisdictions are
aggressively interpreting their laws in new ways in an effort to
raise additional tax revenue. Our existing corporate structure and
intercompany arrangements have been implemented in a manner we
believe is in compliance with current prevailing tax laws. However,
the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may
challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or
intercompany arrangements, or determining the location(s) of
management and control, which could impact our worldwide effective
tax rate and adversely affect our financial condition and results
of operations. Moreover, changes to our corporate structure and
intercompany agreements, including through future acquisitions or
divestitures, in addition to changes in domestic or international
tax laws (such as the proposed 15% global minimum tax, which has
been implemented into the domestic laws of some jurisdictions)
could impact our worldwide effective tax rate and adversely affect
our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

In addition, we are subject to federal, state, and local taxes in
the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant
judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and our
worldwide provision for taxes. During the ordinary course of
business, there are many activities and transactions for which the
ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our tax obligations and
effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the
relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, principles,
and interpretations, including those relating to income tax nexus,
by our earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where
we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in
jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, and by
challenges to our
                                55

intercompany relationships and transfer pricing arrangements. The
relevant taxing authorities may disagree with our determinations as
to the income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions.
If such a disagreement were to occur, and our position were not
sustained, we could be required to pay additional taxes, interest,
and penalties, which could result in one-time tax charges, higher
effective tax rates, reduced cash flows and lower overall
profitability of our business, with some changes possibly affecting
our tax obligations in future or past years. We believe that our
financial statements reflect adequate reserves to cover such a
contingency, but there can be no assurances in that regard.

Taxing authorities may successfully assert that we should have
collected or in the future should collect sales and use, value
added or similar taxes, and any such assessments could adversely
affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.

We collect sales tax and value added taxes in a number of
jurisdictions. Sales and use, value added, digital service, and
similar tax laws and rates vary greatly by jurisdiction. Certain
jurisdictions in which we do not collect such taxes may assert that
such taxes are applicable or that our presence in such
jurisdictions is sufficient to require us to collect taxes, which
could result in tax assessments, penalties, and interest, and we
may be required to collect such taxes in the future. Such tax
assessments, penalties, and interest or future requirements may
adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Further, following the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in June of 2018
in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc., U.S. states may require an out-
of-state seller with no in-state property or personnel to collect
and remit sales tax on sales to the state’s residents, which may
permit wider enforcement of sales tax collection requirements.
Therefore, the application of existing or future laws relating to
sales tax to our business, or the audit of our business and
operations with respect to such taxes or challenges of our
positions by taxing authorities, all could result in increased tax
liabilities for us or our customers, create additional
administrative burdens for us, put us at a competitive disadvantage
if such states do not impose similar obligations on our
competitors, and decrease our future sales, which could adversely
affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.

We may not be able to realize tax savings from our international
structure, which could materially and adversely affect our results
of operations.

In 2023, we completed an international restructuring that included
the inter-entity license of certain intellectual property and other
assets used in the business to our Singapore subsidiary. This
structure may be challenged by tax authorities, and if such
challenges are successful, the tax savings we expect to realize
could be adversely affected. If substantial modifications to our
international structure or the way we operate our business are
made, such as if future acquisitions or divestitures occur, if
changes in domestic and international tax laws negatively impact
the structure (such as the 15% global minimum tax, which has been
implemented into the domestic laws of some jurisdictions), if we do
not operate our business consistent with the structure and
applicable tax provisions, if we fail to achieve our revenue and
profit goals, or if the international structure or our application
of arm's-length principles to intercompany arrangements is
successfully challenged by the U.S. or foreign tax authorities, our
effective tax rate may increase, which could materially and
adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

If we are found liable for content or advertising that is served
through our advertising solutions, our business could be adversely
affected.

As a distributor of content, we face potential liability for
negligence, copyright, patent or trademark infringement, public
performance royalties, or other claims based on the nature and
content of materials that we distribute. The Digital Millennium
Copyright Act (the "DMCA") is intended, in part, to limit the
liability of eligible service providers for caching, hosting, or
linking to user content that includes materials that infringe
copyrights or other rights. We rely on the protections provided by
the DMCA in conducting our business. Similarly, Section 230 of the
Communications Decency Act ("Section 230") protects online
distribution platforms, such as ours, from actions taken under
various laws that might otherwise impose liability on the platform
provider for what content creators develop or the actions they take
or inspire.

However, the DMCA, Section 230, and similar statutes and doctrines
that we may rely on in the future are subject to uncertain judicial
interpretation and regulatory and legislative amendments. Future
regulatory or legislative changes may ultimately require us to take
a more active approach towards content moderation, which could
diminish the depth, breadth, and variety of content we offer and,
in so doing, reduce our revenue. Moreover, the DMCA and Section 230
provide protections primarily in the United States. If the rules
around these statutes and doctrines change, if international
jurisdictions refuse to apply similar protections, or if a court
were to disagree with our application of those rules to our
business, we could incur liability and our business could be
adversely affected. If we become liable for these types of claims
as a result of the content or the advertisements that are served
through our advertising solutions, then our business may be
adversely affected. Litigation to defend these claims
                                56                                 
Table of Contents
could be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any
liability could adversely affect our business. Our insurance may
not be adequate to cover these types of claims or any liability
that may be imposed on us.

In addition, regardless of any legal protections that may limit our
liability for the actions of third parties, we may incur
significant legal expenses and other costs if copyright holders
assert claims, or commence litigation, alleging copyright
infringement against our third-party developers. While we prohibit
mobile apps without distribution rights from the copyright holder,
and we maintain processes and systems for the reporting and removal
of infringing mobile apps, such prohibitions, processes, and
systems may not always be successful. If other developers,
licensees, platform providers, business partners, and personnel are
influenced by the existence of types of claims or proceedings and
are deterred from working with us as a consequence, our ability to
maintain or expand our business, including through international
expansion plans, could be adversely affected.

We have incurred and will continue to incur increased costs and
demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and
regulations affecting public companies, which could adversely
affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.

We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act,
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act"), and the
rules and regulations of the SEC and the Nasdaq listing standards.
The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual,
quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and
results of operations. Compliance with these requirements has
increased and will continue to increase our legal, accounting, and
financial compliance costs and increase demand on our systems,
making some activities more time-consuming and costly. We believe
these rules and regulations have made it more expensive for us to
obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be
required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur
substantially higher costs to maintain the same or similar
coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract
and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors
or as our executive officers. As a public company, we have incurred
and expect to incur significant expenses and devote substantial
management effort toward ensuring compliance with the auditor
attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
In addition, as a public company, we may be subject to shareholder
activism, which can lead to substantial costs, distract management,
and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we
cannot currently anticipate.

As a result of disclosure of information in our public filings with
the SEC as required of a public company, our business and financial
condition has become more visible, which has resulted in and may in
the future result in threatened or actual litigation, including by
competitors and other third parties. For example, beginning in
March 2025, several securities complaints were filed against us,
our board of directors, and/or certain of our officers alleging
violations of the Exchange Act concerning statements made regarding
our advertising solutions and our financial growth. If such claims
are successful, our business, financial condition, and results of
operations could be adversely affected, and even if the claims do
not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these
claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could
divert the resources of our management and our board of directors
and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results
of operations.

Legal or regulatory proceedings and settlements could cause us to
incur additional expenses or otherwise adversely affect our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We are involved in or may become involved in claims, suits,
government investigations, including formal and informal inquiries
or requests for information or audits from government authorities
and regulators, and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of
our business, including actions with respect to intellectual
property claims, securities claims, privacy, data protection,
consumer protection, competition or law enforcement matters, tax
matters, labor and employment claims, commercial and acquisition-
related claims, and other matters in the United States, Europe, and
around the world, especially as we continue to grow and expand our
operations. Further, following our sale of our Apps Business in
June 2025, we have retained responsibility for certain legal
proceedings related to our former studios. While these proceedings
are not expected to be material, we expect to incur additional
costs related to the resolution of these matters.

Any such claims, suits, government investigations, and proceedings
are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with
certainty. Regardless of their outcomes, such legal or regulatory
proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal
costs, diversion of management and other personnel attention, and
other factors. In addition, it is possible that a resolution of one
or more such proceedings could result in substantial costs, civil
and criminal liability, penalties, or sanctions, as well as
judgments, consent decrees, or orders preventing us from offering
certain features, functionalities, products or services, or
requiring a change in our business practices, products or
technologies, which could adversely affect our reputation,
business, financial condition, and results of operations.
                                57                                 
Table of Contents
                                                                   
  Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property                       
                                                                   
Failure to protect or enforce our proprietary and intellectual
property rights or the costs involved in such enforcement could
adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.

We regard our advertising solutions and related source code as
proprietary and rely on a variety of methods, including a
combination of copyright, patent, trademark, and trade secret laws
and employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements, to protect
our proprietary rights. We view the protection of our trade
secrets, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, domain
names, patents, and other product rights as critical to our
success. We strive to protect our intellectual property rights by
relying on federal, state, and common law rights, as well as
contractual restrictions and business practices. We also enter into
confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our
employees and contractors and confidentiality agreements with
parties with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to,
and disclosure and use of, our proprietary information. However,
these contractual arrangements and business practices may not
prevent the misappropriation of our proprietary information or
deter independent development of similar technologies by others.

We own or license, and pursue the registration of, copyrights,
trademarks, service marks, domain names, and patents in the United
States and in certain locations outside the United States. This
process can be expensive and time-consuming, may not always be
successful depending on local laws or other circumstances, and we
also may choose not to pursue registrations in every location
depending on the nature of the project to which the intellectual
property rights pertain. We may, over time, increase our
investments in protecting our creative works.

We also cannot be certain that existing intellectual property laws
will provide adequate protection for our products in connection
with emerging technologies. For example, laws relating to
intellectual property ownership and license rights, including
copyright, with respect to AI and the use of tools containing AI
have not been fully interpreted by U.S. courts or been fully
addressed by federal and state regulations. As a result, our
ability to fully protect our products, technologies and solutions
under current and future legal regimes, especially as it relates to
AI tools and technologies, may be limited or impacted by future
laws, regulations, interpretations or other legislative or judicial
actions. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual
property rights, protect our trade secrets, or determine the
validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. Any
litigation of this nature, regardless of outcome or merit, could
result in substantial costs, adverse publicity, and diversion of
management and technical resources. If we fail to maintain,
protect, and enhance our intellectual property rights, our
business, financial condition, and results of operations could be
adversely affected.

We are, and may in the future be, subject to intellectual property
disputes, which are costly to defend and could require us to pay
significant damages and could limit our ability to use certain
technologies in the future.

From time to time, we have faced, and we may face in the future,
allegations that we have infringed the trademarks, copyrights,
patents, and other intellectual property rights of third parties,
including from our competitors, non-practicing entities and former
employers of our personnel. Intellectual property litigation may be
protracted and expensive, and the results are difficult to predict.
As a result of any court judgment or settlement, we may be
obligated to alter our advertising solutions, in a particular
geographic region or worldwide, pay royalties or significant
settlement costs, purchase licenses, or develop substitutes.

In certain of our agreements, we also indemnify our licensees and
other business partners. We may incur significant expenses
defending these business partners if they are sued for intellectual
property infringement based on allegations related to our
technology. If a business partner were to lose a lawsuit and in
turn seek indemnification from us, we also could be subject to
significant monetary liabilities. In addition, because our
advertising solutions often involve the use of third-party
technology, this increases our exposure to litigation in
circumstances where there is a claim of infringement asserted
against one of our products and services in question, even if the
claim does not pertain to our technology.

Many of our products and services contain open source software, and
we license some of our software through open source projects, which
may pose particular risks to our proprietary software, products,
and services in a manner that could adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.

We use open source software in our advertising solutions and expect
to continue to use open source software in the future. In addition,
we contribute software source code to open source projects under
open source licenses or release internal software projects under
open source licenses, and anticipate continuing to do so in the
future. The terms of many open source licenses to which we are
subject have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and
there is a risk that open source software licenses could be
construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated
                                58                                 
Table of Contents
conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide or distribute
our products or services. Additionally, under some open source
licenses, if we combine our proprietary software with open source
software in a certain manner, third parties may claim ownership of,
a license to, or demand release of, the open source software or
derivative works that we developed using such software, which could
include our proprietary source code. Such third parties may also
seek to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license
through litigation which, if successful, could require us to make
our proprietary software source code freely available, purchase a
costly license, or cease offering the implicated products or
services unless and until we can re-engineer them to avoid
infringement. This re-engineering process could require significant
additional research and development resources, and we may not be
able to complete it successfully. In addition to risks related to
open source license requirements, use of certain open source
software may pose greater risks than use of third-party commercial
software, since open source licensors generally do not provide
warranties or controls on the origin of software and open source
software could incorporate AI generated code which may be a result
of hallucinatory behavior. Any of these risks could be difficult to
eliminate or manage, and, if not addressed, could adversely affect
our business, reputation, financial condition, and results of
operations.
                                                                   
   Risks Related to Financial and Accounting Matters               
                                                                   
If we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls
and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to
produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with
applicable regulations could be impaired.

As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements
of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the rules and
regulations of the applicable Nasdaq listing standards. We expect
that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue
to increase our legal, accounting, and financial compliance costs,
make some activities more difficult, time-consuming and costly, and
place significant strain on our personnel, systems, and resources.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we
maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal
control over financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and
refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us
in the reports that we will file with the SEC is recorded,
processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods
specified in SEC rules and forms and that information required to
be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and
communicated to our principal executive and financial officers.

In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will
continue to expend, significant resources, including accounting-
related costs and significant management oversight. If any of these
new or improved controls and systems do not perform as expected, we
may experience deficiencies in our controls. The effectiveness of
our controls and procedures may also be limited by a variety of
factors including faulty human judgment and simple errors,
omissions or mistakes, fraudulent action of an individual or
collusion of two or more people, and inappropriate management
override of controls and procedures.

Our current controls and any new controls that we develop may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business.
Further, to the extent we acquire other businesses, the acquired
company may not have a sufficiently robust system of controls and
we may discover deficiencies. Any failure to develop or maintain
effective controls or any difficulties encountered in their
implementation or improvement could adversely affect our results of
operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations
and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for
prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective
internal control over financial reporting also could adversely
affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual
independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports
regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting that we are required to include in our periodic reports
that are filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and
procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also
cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and
other information, which would likely cause the market price of our
Class A common stock to decline. In addition, if we are unable to
continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain
listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. As a public company, we
are required to provide an annual management report on the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and
our independent registered public accounting firm is required to
formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting
firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not
satisfied with the level at which our internal control over
financial reporting is documented, designed, or operating. Any
failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal
control over financial reporting could adversely affect our
business, financial condition, and results of operations and could
cause the market price of our Class A common
                                59

stock to decline.

We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if
our goodwill becomes impaired.

We are required under GAAP to review our goodwill for impairment at
least annually or more frequently when events or changes in
circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances,
indicating a requirement to reevaluate whether our goodwill
continues to be recoverable, include a significant decline in the
market price of our Class A common stock and our market
capitalization, slower growth rates in our industry,
underperformance of certain assets, or other materially adverse
events. We may be required to record a significant charge to
earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any
impairment of our goodwill is determined.

We have indebtedness, and our obligations thereunder may limit our
operational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.

As of September 30, 2025, we had a total of $3.6 billion in
aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding
(the “Senior Notes”). We also had $1.0 billion of commitments (with
a $100 million letter of credit sublimit) under our senior
unsecured credit agreement that provides for an unsecured revolving
credit facility (the “Credit Agreement”). As of September 30, 2025,
we did not have outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement.

Our indebtedness could adversely impact us. For example, these
obligations could among other things:

• require us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow
from operations to service and repay the indebtedness, reducing the
amount of cash flow available for other purposes;

• make it difficult for us to pay other obligations;

• increase our cost of borrowing;

• make it difficult to obtain favorable terms for any necessary
future financing for working capital, capital expenditures,
strategic acquisitions and partnerships, debt service requirements,
or other purposes;

• restrict us from making strategic acquisitions and partnerships
or cause us to make divestitures or similar transactions;

• adversely affect our liquidity and result in a material adverse
effect on our financial condition upon repayment of the
indebtedness;

• increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry
conditions;

• increase our exposure to interest rate risk from variable rate
indebtedness;

• place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less
leveraged competitors; and

• limit our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in
our business.

In addition, from time to time we have entered into interest rate
swap instruments to limit our exposure to changes in variable
interest rates. While our hedging strategy is designed to minimize
the impact of increases in interest rates applicable to our
variable rate debt, including our credit facility, there can be no
guarantee that our hedging strategy will be effective, and we may
experience credit-related losses in some circumstances. Upon the
occurrence of a change of control repurchase event (as defined in
the indenture governing the Senior Notes), we will be required to
repurchase the Senior Notes at the option of each holder. We may
not have sufficient funds to repurchase the Senior Notes in cash at
the time of any change of control repurchase event. Upon the
occurrence of a change of control (as defined in the Credit
Agreement), the lenders thereunder could accelerate the obligations
under the Credit Agreement and terminate the commitments under the
Credit Agreement. The indentures governing the Senior Notes also
include customary affirmative and negative covenants (including
covenants restricting our ability to incur certain liens and enter
into sale and leaseback transactions, subject to certain
exceptions), events of default, and other customary provisions. The
Credit Agreement also imposes restrictions on us and requires us to
maintain compliance with specified covenants regardless of whether
any amounts are outstanding thereunder. Our ability to comply with
these covenants may be affected by market, economic, financial,
competitive, legislative, and regulatory factors, as well as other
factors that are beyond our control. A breach of any of the
covenants in the indentures governing the Senior Notes or the
Credit Agreement could result in an event of default, which, if not
cured or waived, could trigger acceleration of our indebtedness and
an increase in the interest rates applicable to such indebtedness
(in the case of the Credit Agreement), and may result in the
acceleration of or default under any other debt we may incur in the
future to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision
applies. The
                                60                                 
Table of Contents
acceleration of the indebtedness under the Credit Agreement, the
Senior Notes, or under any other indebtedness could have a material
and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and
results of operations.

We receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in
the United States. Factors that may impact our credit ratings
include debt levels, planned asset purchases or sales and near-term
and long-term growth opportunities. Liquidity, asset quality and
cost structure could also be considered by the rating agencies. The
applicable margins with respect to the loans incurred under the
Credit Agreement will vary based on our applicable public debt
credit ratings assigned by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.,
Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC, Fitch’s and any successor
to each such rating agency business. Moreover, our Senior Notes are
currently rated investment-grade by various rating agencies. A
ratings downgrade, including any announcement that our ratings are
under further review for a downgrade, could adversely impact our
ability to access debt markets in the future and increase the cost
of current or future debt and may adversely affect our share price.

We may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our
significant debt service obligations, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations, and cash flows.

Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt
obligations depends on our financial condition and results of
operations, which are subject to prevailing economic and
competitive conditions and to certain financial, business,
legislative, regulatory, and other factors beyond our control. We
may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating
activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium,
if any, or interest on our indebtedness. If our cash flows and
capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service
obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay strategic
acquisitions and partnerships, capital expenditures, and payments
on account of other obligations, seek additional capital,
restructure or refinance our indebtedness, or sell assets. These
alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to
meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our ability to
restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of
the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any
refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and could
require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could
further restrict our business operations. In addition, we cannot
assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our
indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.

If we are unable to repay or otherwise refinance our indebtedness
when due, or if any other event of default is not cured or waived,
the applicable lenders or holders could accelerate our outstanding
obligations, which could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation.
In the event the applicable lenders or holders accelerate the
repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have
sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. Any acceleration of
amounts due under the agreements governing our indebtedness could
have a material and adverse effect on our business.

We may require additional capital to meet our financial obligations
and support business growth, and this capital may not be available
on acceptable terms or at all.

We intend to continue to make significant investments to support
our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to
business challenges, including the need to continue to develop our
advertising solutions, improve our operating infrastructure, or
enter into new markets or strategic transactions. Accordingly, we
may need to engage in equity, equity-linked, or debt financings to
secure additional funds. Our ability to obtain additional financing
that we may choose or need, including for the refinancing of future
debt maturities or potential strategic acquisitions and
investments, will depend on, among other things, our development
efforts, business plans, operating performance, and the condition
of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. Also, if we
raise additional funds through future issuances of equity or
equity-linked securities, our existing stockholders could
experience significant dilution, and any new equity securities we
issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to
those of holders of our Class A common stock. Any debt financing
that we secure in the future could involve offering security
interests and undertaking restrictive covenants relating to our
capital raising activities and other financial and operational
matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain
additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including
potential acquisitions. Our Credit Agreement, which provides for a
revolving credit facility, contains a financial covenant with which
we must comply. We may not be able to obtain additional financing
on terms favorable to us, if at all. Additionally, if we seek to
access additional capital or increase our borrowing, there can be
no assurance that financing and credit may be available on
favorable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate
financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require
it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to
respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired, and
our business, financial condition, or results of operations could
be adversely affected.

Risks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock and
Governance
The multi-class structure of our common stock and the Voting
Agreement among the Voting Agreement Parties have the effect of
concentrating voting power with the Voting Agreement Parties, which
will limit your ability to influence the outcome of matters
submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election
of our board of directors, the adoption of amendments to our
certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and the approval of any
merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our
assets, or other major corporate transactions.

We have three classes of common stock. Our Class A common stock has
one vote per share, our Class B common stock has 20 votes per
share, and our Class C common stock has no voting rights, except as
otherwise required by law. Adam Foroughi, our co-founder, CEO, and
Chairperson and Herald Chen, a member of our board of directors
(collectively with certain affiliates, the "Voting Agreement
Parties") together hold all of the issued and outstanding shares of
our Class B common stock. As of September 30, 2025, the Voting
Agreement Parties collectively held approximately 67% of the voting
power of our outstanding capital stock in the aggregate. This
voting power includes shares of Class A common stock deemed
beneficially owned in accordance with Rule 13d-3(d)(1) under the
Exchange Act. The Voting Agreement Parties have entered into a
voting agreement (the "Voting Agreement") whereby all Class B
common stock held by the Voting Agreement Parties and their
respective permitted entities and permitted transferees will be
voted as determined by Mr. Foroughi and Mr. Chen. As a result, the
Voting Agreement Parties will collectively be able to determine or
significantly influence any action requiring the approval of our
stockholders, including the election of our board of directors, the
adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation and
bylaws, and the approval of any merger, consolidation, sale of all
or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate
transaction. The Voting Agreement Parties may have interests that
differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree,
and which may be adverse to your interests. This concentrated
control may have the effect of delaying, preventing, or deterring a
change in control of our company, could deprive our stockholders of
an opportunity to receive a premium for their capital stock as part
of a sale of our company, and might ultimately affect the market
price of our Class A common stock.

Future transfers by the holders of Class B common stock will
generally result in those shares automatically converting into
shares of Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such
as certain transfers effected for estate planning, or other
transfers among the Voting Agreement Parties. In addition, each
share of Class B common stock will convert automatically into one
share of Class A common stock upon certain events specified in our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation.

In addition, because our Class C common stock carries no voting
rights (except as otherwise required by law), if we issue Class C
common stock in the future, the holders of Class B common stock may
be able to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome
of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders for a
longer period of time than would be the case if we issued Class A
common stock rather than Class C common stock in such transactions.

We are considered a “controlled company” within the meaning of the
Nasdaq corporate governance requirements, and, as a result, we
qualify for exemptions from certain corporate governance
requirements.

As a result of our multi-class common stock structure and the
Voting Agreement among the Voting Agreement Parties, the Voting
Agreement Parties collectively hold greater than a majority of the
voting power of our outstanding capital stock and the Voting
Agreement Parties have the authority to vote the shares of all
Class B common stock, subject to the terms of the Voting Agreement,
at their discretion on all matters to be voted upon by
stockholders. Therefore, we are considered a “controlled company”
as that term is set forth in the Nasdaq corporate governance
requirements. Under these corporate governance requirements, a
company in which over 50% of the voting power for the election of
directors is held by an individual, a group, or another company is
a “controlled company” and may elect not to comply with certain
corporate governance requirements, including:

• the requirement that a majority of its board of directors consist
of independent directors;

• the requirement that we have a nominating/corporate governance
committee that is comprised entirely of independent directors with
a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and
responsibilities;

• the requirement that we have a compensation committee that is
comprised entirely of independent directors with a written charter
addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities; and

• the requirement for an annual performance evaluation of the
nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees.

We do not currently avail ourselves of any of these corporate
governance accommodations, though we may
                                62

do so in the future. In the event that we cease to be a “controlled
company” and our Class A common stock continues to be listed on
Nasdaq, we will be required to comply with these provisions within
the applicable transition periods.

The market price of our Class A common stock could be volatile, and
you could lose all or part of your investment.

The market price of our Class A common stock has fluctuated, and
may continue to fluctuate, substantially depending on a number of
factors, including those described in this “Risk Factors” section,
many of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our
operating performance. These fluctuations could cause you to lose
all or part of your investment in our Class A common stock. Factors
that have in the past caused and could in the future cause
fluctuations in the market price of our Class A common stock
include the following:

• price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from
time to time, including fluctuations due to general economic
uncertainty or negative market sentiment;

• volatility in the market and trading volumes of technology
stocks;

• our indication of interest to explore a purchase of TikTok in all
markets outside of China, including public perceptions regarding
our proposal and the likelihood that we will enter into a
definitive agreement to acquire TikTok in all markets outside of
China;

• changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of
other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in
particular;

• sales of shares of our Class A common stock by us or our
stockholders;

• rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in
our industry;

• failure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us,
changes in financial estimates by securities analysts who follow
our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the
expectations of investors;

• actual or perceived significant data breaches involving our
advertising solutions;

• the financial or non-financial metric projections we may provide
to the public, any changes in those projections or our failure to
meet those projections;

• third-party data published about us or other advertising or
mobile gaming companies, whether or not such data accurately
reflects circumstances;

• announcements by us or our competitors of new products or
services;

• the public’s reaction to our press releases, other public
announcements, and filings with the SEC;

• fluctuations in the trading volume of shares of our Class A
common stock or the size of our public float;

• short selling of our Class A common stock or related derivative
securities, and the publication of short seller reports;

• actual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our results of
operations;

• actual or anticipated developments in our business, our
competitors’ businesses, or the competitive landscape generally;

• our issuance or repurchase of shares of our Class A common stock;

• litigation or regulatory action involving us, our industry or
both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those
of our competitors;

• developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or
other proprietary rights;

• announced or completed acquisitions of businesses or technologies
by us or our competitors;

• new laws, regulations or app store policies or new
interpretations of existing laws, regulations or app store policies
applicable to our business;

• changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines,
interpretations, or principles;

• major catastrophic events in our domestic and foreign markets;
                                63                                 
Table of Contents
• any significant change in our management; and

• general economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our
markets.

In addition, the market price of our Class A common stock has in
the past fluctuated and could in the future fluctuate for reasons
unrelated to our business, financial condition, or results of
operations, including if the market for technology stocks or the
stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence.
The market price of our Class A common stock might also decline in
reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even
if these events do not directly affect us. Accordingly, we cannot
assure you of the liquidity of any trading market, your ability to
sell your shares of our Class A common stock when desired, or the
prices that you may obtain for your shares of our Class A common
stock.

In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of
a company’s securities, securities class action litigation has
often been brought against that company. If the market price of our
Class A common stock is volatile, we may become the target of
securities litigation. Securities litigation could result in
substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and
resources from our business. Such litigation could adversely affect
our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We may not realize the anticipated long-term stockholder value of
our share repurchase programs and any failure to repurchase our
Class A common stock after we have announced our intention to do so
may negatively impact our stock price.

Our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program
under which we repurchase shares of our Class A common stock from
time to time. We may make share repurchases through a variety of
methods, including open share market purchases, block transactions
or privately negotiated transactions, in accordance with applicable
federal securities laws. Our share repurchase program has no time
limit, does not obligate us to repurchase any specific number of
shares and may be suspended at any time at our discretion and
without prior notice. The timing and amount of any repurchases, if
any, will be subject to liquidity, stock price, market and economic
conditions, compliance with applicable legal requirements such as
Delaware surplus and solvency tests, compliance with our credit
agreement, and other relevant factors. Any failure to repurchase
stock after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively
impact our reputation and investor confidence in us and may
negatively impact our stock price.

The existence of this share repurchase program could cause our
stock price to be higher than it otherwise would be and could
potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. Although
this program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value,
there is no assurance it will do so because the market price of our
Class A common stock may decline below the levels at which we
repurchased shares and short-term stock price fluctuations could
reduce the effectiveness of the program.

Repurchasing our Class A common stock will reduce the amount of
cash we have available to fund working capital, capital
expenditures, strategic acquisitions or business opportunities, and
other general corporate requirements, and we may fail to realize
the anticipated long-term stockholder value of any share repurchase
programs.

The issuance of additional stock in connection with financings,
acquisitions, investments, our equity incentive plans, or otherwise
will dilute all other stockholders.

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us
to issue up to 1,500,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, up to
150,000,000 shares of Class C common stock, and up to 100,000,000
shares of preferred stock with such rights and preferences as may
be determined by our board of directors. Subject to compliance with
applicable rules and regulations, we may issue shares of Class A
common stock or securities convertible into shares of our Class A
common stock from time to time in connection with a financing,
acquisition, investment, our equity incentive plans, or otherwise.
For example, a purchase of TikTok in all markets outside of China,
if it were to take place, would likely require us to issue a
significant amount of equity. Any such issuance could result in
dilution to our existing stockholders and/or negatively impact the
market price of our Class A common stock.
                                64

Our multi-class stock structure, the Voting Agreement, and other
provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
and amended and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer,
or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the market price of
our Class A common stock.

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended
and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the
acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:

• our multi-class common stock structure and the Voting Agreement,
which provide the Voting Agreement Parties with the ability to
determine or significantly influence the outcome of matters
requiring stockholder approval, even if they own significantly less
than a majority of the shares of our outstanding common stock;

• vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by our
board of directors and not by stockholders;

• a special meeting of our stockholders may only be called by a
majority of our board of directors, the chairperson of our board of
directors, our Chief Executive Officer, or our President;

• advance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate
candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an
annual meeting of stockholders;

• our amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not
provide for cumulative voting;

• our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes
undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established
and shares of which may be issued by our board of directors,
without further action by our stockholders;

• after the first date on which the outstanding shares of our Class
B common stock represent less than a majority of the total combined
voting power of our Class A common stock and our Class B common
stock (the "Voting Threshold Date"), our stockholders will only be
able to take action at a meeting of stockholders and will not be
able to take action by written consent for any matter; and

• certain litigation against us may only be brought in Delaware.

These provisions, alone or together, could discourage, delay, or
prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company.
These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it
more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their
choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they
desire, any of which, under certain circumstances, could limit the
opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their
shares of our Class A common stock, and could also affect the
market price of our Class A common stock.

Our amended and restated bylaws designate a state or federal court
located within the State of Delaware and the federal district
courts of the United States as the exclusive forum for
substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which
could limit our stockholders’ ability to choose the judicial forum
for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.

Our amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent in
writing to the selection of an alternative forum, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any
derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any
action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any
of our directors, officers, or other employees to us or our
stockholders, (iii) any action arising pursuant to any provision of
the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws,
or (iv) any other action asserting a claim that is governed by the
internal affairs doctrine shall be the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have
jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of
Delaware), in all cases subject to the court having jurisdiction
over indispensable parties named as defendants, and provided that
this exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to
enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act.

Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction
for federal and state courts over all such Securities Act actions.
Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to
entertain such claims. To prevent having to litigate claims in
multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary
rulings by different courts, among other considerations, our
amended and restated bylaws also provide that the federal district
courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum
for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising
under the Securities Act. However, while the Delaware Supreme Court
ruled in March 2020 that federal forum selection provisions
purporting to require claims under the Securities Act be brought in
federal court are “facially valid” under Delaware law, there is
uncertainty as to whether other courts will enforce our federal
forum provision. If the federal forum provision is found to be
unenforceable, we may incur additional costs associated with
resolving such matters.
                                65                                 
Table of Contents
Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding
or owning (or continuing to hold or own) any interest in any of our
securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the
foregoing bylaw provisions. Although we believe these exclusive
forum provisions benefit us by providing increased consistency in
the application of Delaware law and federal securities laws in the
types of lawsuits to which each applies, the exclusive forum
provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a
judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or any of our
directors, officers, stockholders, or other employees, which may
discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims against us and our
current and former directors, officers, stockholders, or other
employees. Our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our
compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and
regulations thereunder as a result of our exclusive forum
provisions. Further, in the event a court finds either exclusive
forum provision contained in our amended and restated bylaws to be
unenforceable or inapplicable in an action, we may incur additional
costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions,
which could harm our results of operations.

During the three months ended September 30, 2025, we issued
restricted stock units ("RSUs") covering 6,860 shares of our Class
A common stock under our 2021 Partner Studio Incentive Plan (the
"PSIP") and issued 3,790 shares of our Class A common stock upon
the vesting and settlement of RSUs issued under our PSIP.

The foregoing transactions did not involve any underwriters, any
underwriting discounts or commissions, or any public offering. We
believe the offer, sale, and issuance of the above securities was
exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the “Act”) by virtue of Section 4(a)(2) of the Act and
Regulation S promulgated under the Act, because the issuance of
securities to the recipients did not involve a public offering. The
recipients of the securities in the transaction represented their
intentions to acquire the securities for investment only and not
with a view to or for sale in connection with any distribution
thereof, and appropriate legends were placed upon the stock
certificates issued in the transaction. All recipients had adequate
access, through their relationships with us or otherwise, to
information about us. The issuance of these securities was made
without any general solicitation or advertising.

(1) In February 2022, our board of directors authorized a share
repurchase program to purchase shares of our Class A common stock.
In October 2025, our board of directors authorized an increase to
the repurchase program of $3.2 billion, such that an aggregate
amount of approximately $3.3 billion remained available for
repurchases as of October 31, 2025. Repurchases may be made from
time to time through open market purchases or through privately
negotiated transactions, subject to market conditions, applicable
legal requirements, including surplus and solvency requirements,
and other relevant factors. Open market repurchases may be
structured to occur in accordance with the requirements of Rule
10b-18. We may also, from time to time, enter into Rule 10b-5
trading plans to facilitate repurchases of shares. The repurchase
program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of
our Class A common stock, has no expiration date and may be
modified, suspended, or terminated at any time at our discretion.
See Note 8 - Equity of the Notes to condensed consolidated
financial statements in Part I, Item I of this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q for additional information related to share repurchases.

associated with the repurchases under our repurchase program.
