EXPLANATORY NOTE On March 12, 2021, AppLovin Corporation (the “Company”)    
entered into an Amended and Restated Share Purchase Agreement by and among  
the Company, Applovin Active Holdings, LLC, adjust GmbH (“Adjust”), the     
shareholders of Adjust and Spree Eternity GmbH, which was amended on March  
30, 2021 (as amended, the “Purchase Agreement”). The Company previously     
reported the entry into the Purchase Agreement in Amendment No. 2 to the    
Registration Statement on Form S-1(File No. 333-258500)filed with the       
Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on April 7, 2021. The Company
is hereby reporting the closing of the transaction contemplated by the      
Purchase Agreement. The Company will amend this Current Report on Form      
8-Kwithin 71 days after April 26, 2021, the date by which this Form 8-Kwas  
required to be filed, to file with the SEC the financial statements of      
Adjust and related pro forma financial information as required by parts (a) 
and (b) of Item 9.01 of Form 8-Kwithin the time period specified in Form    
8-K.                                                                        
                                                                  
  Item 2.01  Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.  
                                                                  
On April 20, 2021, the Company completed its previously announced           
acquisition of Adjust pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to the   
terms of the Purchase Agreement, on April 20, 2021, the Company acquired all
the outstanding shares of Adjust in exchange for (i) $598.0 million in cash,
subject to certain purchase price adjustments; (ii) convertible securities  
that automatically convert into an aggregate number of shares of our Class A
common stock determined by dividing $352.0 million by the volume-weighted   
average trading price per share of our Class A common stock over any 10     
consecutive full trading day period (chosen by the stockholder              
representative under the Purchase Agreement) within 20 trading days         
commencing with and following April 15, 2021; and (iii) the assumption of up
to $40.0 million in the aggregate of debt, accrued interest, and fees of    
Adjust, in each case upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the    
Purchase Agreement. The issuance of the convertible securities did not      
involve any underwriters, any underwriting discounts or commissions, or any 
public offering. The Company believes the offer, sale, and issuance of the  
convertible securities was exempt from registration under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) by virtue of Section 4(a)(2) of  
the Securities Act and Regulation S promulgated under the Securities Act,   
because the issuance of securities to the recipients did not involve a      
public offering. The shares of our Class A common stock issuable upon       
conversion of the convertible securities will be issued in reliance on the  
exemption from registration in Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act because
no commission or other remuneration is expected to be paid in connection    
with conversion of the convertible securities and the resulting issuance of 
shares of our Class A common stock. The recipients of the securities in the 
transaction represented their intentions to acquire the securities for      
investment only and not with a view to or for sale in connection with any   
distribution thereof, and appropriate legends were placed upon the stock    
certificates issued in the transaction. All recipients had adequate access, 
through their relationships with us or otherwise, to information about us.  
The issuance of these securities was made without any general solicitation  
or advertising.                                                             
                                                       
  Item 3.02  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.

into this Item 3.02.
