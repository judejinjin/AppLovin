  Item 8.01  Other Events  
                           
Earnings-Related Lock-UpRelease Date In connection with the Company’s       
initial public offering of Class A common stock (the “IPO”), the Company’s  
executive officers, directors and holders of substantially all of its       
capital stock and securities convertible into or exchangeable for such      
capital stock as of the IPO were parties to market standoff agreements with 
the Company or entered into lock-up agreementswith the underwriters that    
restrict their ability to sell or transfer their shares, or otherwise engage
in certain transactions related to their shares (the “lock-upagreements”),  
for a period of 180 days after April 14, 2021. Such period is referred to as
the lock-up period. Pursuant to the lock-upagreements, 20% of the shares of 
the Company’s common stock held as of April 14, 2021 (and including shares  
issuable upon the exercise of options that are scheduled to be vested as of 
the date that is 90 days thereafter provided, however, the lock-upsignatory 
continues to be a service provider to the Company through such date) shall  
be released from the lock-upagreements at the commencement of trading on the
second trading day after the Company announces earnings for its second      
quarter of 2021. Such release will occur at the commencement of trading on  
August 13, 2021.                                                            
                                                                            
The Company estimates that approximately 69 million shares of Class A common
stock (including approximately 30 million shares of Class B common stock    
convertible into Class A common stock) may become eligible for sale in the  
public market at the open of trading on August 13, 2021, subject to volume  
limitations, manner of sale provisions and notice provisions under Rule 144 
in the case of our affiliates. The Company will also release the market     
standoff agreements with respect to these shares on August 13, 2021.        
Expected Early Lock-Up ReleaseDate Pursuant to the lock-up agreements,if (i)
at least 120 days have elapsed since April 14, 2021, (ii) the Company has   
publicly released earnings results for the quarterly period during which the
IPO occurred and (iii) such lock-upperiod is scheduled to end during or     
within five trading days prior to a broadly applicable and regularly        
scheduled period during which trading in the Company’s securities would not 
be permitted under its insider trading policy (the “blackout period”), such 
lock-upperiod will end ten trading days prior to the commencement of such   
blackout period. The lock-up periodis scheduled to end on October 11, 2021, 
which falls within the Company’s quarterly blackout period that commences at
the end of the day on September 14, 2021. Therefore, in accordance with the 
lock-up agreements, the lock-up periodwill end at the open of trading on    
August 31, 2021, which is ten trading days prior to the commencement of the 
Company’s quarterly blackout period. The Company will also release the      
market standoff agreements when the lock-up periodexpires. The Company      
estimates that approximately 261 million shares of Class A common stock     
(including approximately 118 million shares of Class B common stock         
convertible into Class A common stock) may become eligible for sale in the  
public market at the open of trading on August 31, 2021, subject to volume  
limitations, manner of sale provisions and notice provisions under Rule 144 
in the case of our affiliates.
