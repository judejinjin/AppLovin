Item 3.02 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities                           
In connection with an agreement and plan of reorganization entered into on
February 23, 2022, AppLovin Corporation (the “Company”) agreed to issue an
aggregate of approximately 2.7 million shares of its Class A common stock to
certain security holders of Wurl, Inc. (“Wurl”) as a portion of the
consideration for all of the outstanding equity of Wurl. The Company
estimated the aggregate number of shares based on the average of the daily
volume weighted average price per share of the Company’s Class A common
stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market for the thirty (30) consecutive trading
days ending on February 16, 2022. The final number of shares of the
Company’s Class A common stock to be issued in connection with the
acquisition is subject to adjustment based on purchase price adjustment
provisions in the agreement and plan of reorganization.

The proposed issuance of shares of the Company’s Class A common stock to
certain security holders of Wurl in accordance with the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in the acquisition agreement will be made in
reliance on the private offering exemption of Section 4(a)(2) of the
Securities Act and/or the private offering safe harbor provisions of Rule
506 of Regulation D based on the following factors: (i) the number of
offerees or purchasers, as applicable, (ii) the absence of general
solicitation, (iii) investment representations obtained from the security
holders of Wurl, including with respect to their status as accredited
investors, (iv) the provision of appropriate disclosure, and (v) the
placement of restrictive legends on the certificates reflecting the
securities. The proposed issuance of shares will not involve any
underwriters, any underwriting discounts or commissions, or any public
offering.

Share Repurchase Program                                                    
On February 28, 2022, the Company announced that its board of directors has
authorized the repurchase of up to $750 million of the Company’s Class A
common stock. Repurchases may be made from time to time through open market
purchases or through privately negotiated transactions subject to market
conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. Open
market repurchases may be structured to occur in accordance with the
requirements of Rule 10b-18. The Company may also, from time to time, enter
into Rule 10b5-1 plans to facilitate repurchases of its shares under this
authorization. The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to
acquire any particular amount of its Class A common stock, and may be
suspended at any time at the Company’s discretion.
2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders                                         
The Board has scheduled the Company’s Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the
“Annual Meeting”) for June 8, 2022. Because the Company did not hold an
annual meeting of stockholders in 2021, the Company has set a deadline of
March 10, 2022 for the receipt of any stockholder proposals for inclusion in
the proxy materials to be distributed in connection with the Annual Meeting
pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the “Exchange Act”), which the Company believes to be a reasonable time
before it expects to begin to print and distribute its proxy materials for
the Annual Meeting. Any Exchange Act Rule 14a-8 proposal received after this
date will be considered untimely. Stockholders should send any such proposal
to AppLovin Corporation, Attn: Corporate Secretary, 1100 Page Mill Road,
Palo Alto, California 94304, and such proposal must comply with all
applicable requirements set forth in the rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission, including Exchange Act Rule 14a-8, in
order to be eligible for inclusion in the Company’s proxy materials for the
Annual Meeting.

Pursuant to the Company’s amended and restated bylaws (the “Bylaws”), any
stockholder seeking to raise a proposal outside the processes of Exchange
Act Rule 14a-8 or make a nomination for consideration at the Annual Meeting,
but not included in the proxy materials for the Annual Meeting, must comply
with the requirements of the Bylaws, including by delivering notice of their
proposal or nomination to AppLovin Corporation, Attn: Corporate Secretary,
1100 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto, California 94304, no later than 5:00 p.m.,
Pacific time, on March 10, 2022. Any proposal or nomination received after
such date will be considered untimely and will not be considered at the
Annual Meeting.

An adjournment, rescheduling or postponement of the Annual Meeting date, or
any announcement of such action, will not commence a new time period (or
extend any time period) for giving such notice under the Bylaws or
submitting a proposal pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 14a-8.
