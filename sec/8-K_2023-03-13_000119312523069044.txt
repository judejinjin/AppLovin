  Item 5.02Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of          
  Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of  
  Certain Officers.On March 13, 2023 (the “Grant Date”), the Board of       
  Directors (the “Board’) of AppLovin Corporation (the “Company”), upon     
  the recommendation of the Compensation Committee of the Board (the        
  “Compensation Committee”), approved the grant of awards of                
  performance-based restricted stock units (“PSUs”) under the Company’s     
  2021 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”) to Adam Foroughi, the        
  Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chairperson, and Vasily Shikin,     
  the Company’s Chief Technology Officer; and delegated authority to Mr.    
  Foroughi to grant certain other PSUs to non-executive employees in        
  consultation with the chair of the Compensation Committee (the            
  recipients of such PSUs, the “Additional Participants”).The PSUs will     
  cover a total of 17,255,000 shares of the Company’s Class A common        
  stock. Of this total, 40% of the PSUs will be granted to each of Mr.      
  Foroughi and Mr. Shikin, and the remaining 20% of the PSUs will be        
  granted to the Additional Participants. The PSUs will vest upon the       
  achievement of certain stock price goals, as described below.In           
  addition, the Board, upon the recommendation of the Compensation          
  Committee, approved the grant of awards of restricted stock units         
  covering 520,472 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock under the   
  2021 Plan to each of Mr. Foroughi and Mr. Shikin. These awards vest in    
  full on February 20, 2024, subject to the recipient’s continued role as   
  a service provider to us through such date.The Compensation Committee,    
  in consultation with its independent compensation consultant, Semler      
  Brossy, considered many factors when it determined it was in the best     
  interest of the Company and its stockholders to establish a long-term     
  incentive program tied to the Company’s stock price and the structure of  
  this recommended program. These factors included the percentage           
  ownership in the Company and value of such ownership of Mr. Foroughi,     
  Mr. Shikin, and the potential Additional Participants, and the amount of  
  their ownership interests unvested at the time of grant, market data for  
  similarly situated executives at comparable companies with an emphasis    
  on the ownership percentage and equity value of founder chief executive   
  officers and chief technology officers, the past and expected future      
  contributions to the Company of Mr. Foroughi, Mr. Shikin, and the         
  potential Additional Participants, and the Board’s desire to provide      
  meaningful incentives for Mr. Foroughi, Mr. Shikin and the potential      
  Additional Participants to continue serve in their respective positions   
  and to continue to drive the growth of the business.The Board intends     
  for these PSUs to be the exclusive performance-based equity awards that   
  Mr. Foroughi and Mr. Shikin receive for the next four years, unless       
  there are unexpected changes in Company’s business or other unforeseen    
  factors that the Board or Compensation Committee determine would make it  
  in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders to grant         
  additional equity award(s) to them. Mr. Foroughi and Mr. Shikin will      
  continue to be eligible for time-based equity awards during this          
  period.The Board believed it was important for the PSUs to vest only if   
  the Company achieves certain stock price goals, which if achieved, would  
  allow the Company’s other stockholders to benefit from the increases in   
  the Company’s stock price. To further encourage Mr. Foroughi, Mr.         
  Shikin, and any Additional Participants to focus on the long-term         
  success of the Company’s business, Mr. Foroughi will be required to hold  
  a minimum of 6,902,000 shares of the Company’s Class A and Class B        
  common stock (equal to 100% of the PSUs awarded to him) for a period of   
  five years from the Grant Date, regardless of whether or not any PSUs     
  are actually earned. Mr. Shikin and any Additional Participants must      
  hold anyafter-taxshares that are issued pursuant to the PSUs for at       
  least one year following the date that such shares are issued; provided,  
  however, that this holding period requirement will end upon a change in   
  control and, in the case of Mr. Shikin, will automatically cease upon     
  termination of service for reasons other than a termination by the        
  Company for “cause” or resignation without “good reason,” as such terms   
  are defined in the Company’s Executive Change in Control and Severance    
  Plan.The PSUs are eligible to vest based on the Company’s stock price     
  performance over a performance period beginning on the first trading day  
  following the Grant Date and ending on the fifth anniversary of the       
  Grant Date. Each individual’s award of PSUs is divided into five equal    
  tranches that are eligible to vest based on the achievement of stock      
  price goals (each, a “Company Stock Price Target”), measured based on     
  the minimum closing price of the Company’s Class A common stock over a    
  consecutive 30 trading day period during the performance period as set    
  forth below. This measurement period was designed to reward Mr.           
  Foroughi, Mr. Shikin, and any Additional Participants only if the         
  Company achieved sustained growth in the Company’s stock price.           
                                                                            
                                                                            
  The threshold Company Stock Price target (the “Threshold Price”) will be  
  $36.00 per share, with each tranche increasing by $10.75, making the      
  four additional Company Stock Price Targets $46.75, $57.50, $68.25 and    
  $79.00, each intending to represent incremental increases of              
  approximately $4 billion in the Company’s market capitalization compared  
  to the Threshold Price.The following table presents how many PSUs would   
  be eligible to vest per Company Stock Price Target achieved for each of   
  Mr. Foroughi, Mr. Shikin and the Additional Participants (in              
  aggregate):PSUs Eligible to VestCompany Stock Price TargetAdam

  closing price of the Company’s Class A common stock fails to reach the    
  Threshold Price over a consecutive 30 trading day period during the       
  performance period, or if an individual terminates service to the         
  Company during a period where the closing price of the Company’s Class A  
  common stock is above the Threshold Price but has not yet fulfilled the   
  consecutive 30 trading day period, no portion of the PSUs shall vest.     
  The Company Stock Price Targets and number of shares of the Company’s     
  Class A common stock underlying the PSUs will be adjusted to reflect any  
  stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, reorganizations,             
  reclassifications, or similar event under the 2021 Plan.In the event of   
  a change in control of the Company following the Grant Date but before    
  the end of the performance period, the PSUs may be eligible to vest in    
  additional amounts if the per share transaction price in the change in    
  control is above the Threshold Price but below an additional Company      
  Stock Price Target(s) that has not previously been achieved, in which     
  case the additional amount of PSUs will vest immediately prior to the     
  closing of the change in control.In the event of termination of           
  employment for “cause” or resignation without “good reason” (each as      
  defined their PSU agreement), any portion of a participant’s PSUs for     
  which a Company Stock Price Target has not been achieved will             
  immediately terminate and be forfeited to the Company. For each of Mr.    
  Foroughi and Mr. Shikin, in the event of termination without “cause”,     
  resignation for “good reason”, or termination upon death or disability,   
  any unvested PSUs will remain outstanding and eligible to vest if a       
  Company Stock Price Target is achieved within twelve months of the date   
  of separation.Each vested PSU will be settled in a share of the           
  Company’s Class A common stock on the next company quarterly vesting      
  date occurring on or after the date on which the PSU vests. To the        
  extent required by law or the rules of the stock exchange upon which the  
  Company’s Class A common stock is listed, the Company’s clawback policy   
  will apply to all awards.The foregoing summary is qualified in its        
  entirety by reference to the full text of the form of PSU Agreement
