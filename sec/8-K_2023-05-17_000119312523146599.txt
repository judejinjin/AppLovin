  Item 1.01  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.  
                                                          
On May 17, 2023, AppLovin Corporation (“AppLovin”) entered into an agreement
to repurchase 15,952,381 shares of its Class A common stock, par value      
$0.00003 per share (the “Class A Common Stock”), beneficially owned by KKR  
Denali Holdings L.P. (“KKR Denali”) in a private transaction at a price per 
share equal to $21.00, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $335
million (the “Share Repurchase Agreement”). This represents an approximately
8% discount to the closing price of $22.88 of the Class A Common Stock at   
the close of trading on May 16, 2023. The repurchase of the shares of Class 
A Common Stock pursuant to the Share Repurchase Agreement is expected to    
close by May 18, 2023. The Share Repurchase Agreement contains customary    
representations, warranties and covenants of the parties. A special         
committee of the Board of Directors of AppLovin (the “Special Committee”),  
comprised solely of independent directors not affiliated with KKR Denali,   
approved the Share Repurchase Agreement. The foregoing summary is qualified 
in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Share Repurchase       
Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated by  
reference.                                                                  
                            
  Item 8.01  Other Events.  
                            
As of May 16, 2023, approximately $204 million remained available under     
AppLovin’s previously authorized $750 million share repurchase program. On  
May 16, 2023, the Special Committee authorized an increase of $296 million  
such that up to $500 million of Class A Common Stock may be repurchased.    
Following the closing of the repurchase of the shares of Class A Common     
Stock pursuant to the Share Repurchase Agreement of approximately $335      
million, approximately $165 million will be available under the share       
repurchase program. Repurchases may be made from time to time through open  
market purchases or through privately negotiated transactions subject to    
market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors.
Open market repurchases may be structured to occur in accordance with the   
requirements of Rule 10b-18. AppLovinmay also, from time to time, enter into
Rule 10b5-1 plansto facilitate repurchases of its shares under this         
authorization. The repurchase program does not obligate AppLovin to acquire 
any particular amount of its Class A common stock, and may be suspended at  
any time at AppLovin’s discretion.
