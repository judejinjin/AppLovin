Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On August 18, 2023, AppLovin Corporation (“AppLovin” or “Company”) entered
into Amendment No. 9 (“Amendment No. 9”) to that certain Credit Agreement,
dated as of August 15, 2018, by and among AppLovin, as borrower, Bank of
America, N.A., as administrative agent and collateral agent, and the other
parties thereto, as amended by Amendment No. 1 to the Credit Agreement,
dated as of April 23, 2019, Amendment No. 2 to the Credit Agreement, dated
as of April 27, 2020, Amendment No. 3 to the Credit Agreement, dated as of
May 6, 2020, Amendment No. 4 to the Credit Agreement, dated as of October
27, 2020, Amendment No. 5 to the Credit Agreement, dated as of February 12,
2021, Amendment No. 6 to the Credit Agreement, dated as of October 25, 2021,
Amendment No. 7 to the Credit Agreement, dated January 3, 2023, and
Amendment No. 8 to the Credit Agreement, dated June 12, 2023 (the “Credit
Agreement”; the Credit Agreement as amended by Amendment No. 9, the “Amended
Credit Agreement”).

Pursuant to Amendment No. 9, certain lenders agreed to provide refinancing
term loans in an aggregate amount of $1.5 billion (such replacement term
loans, the “Amendment No. 9 Replacement Term Loans”), the proceeds of which
were used to refinance all term loans (other than term loans extended
pursuant to Amendment No. 6) outstanding immediately prior to the
effectiveness of Amendment No. 9. The Amendment No. 9 Replacement Term Loans
have (a) a maturity date of August 18, 2030 (or if not a business day, the
immediately preceding business day), (b) an interest rate “floor” of 50
basis points if such loans bear interest based on the secured overnight
financing rate (such loans, “Term SOFR Loans”), and (c) an applicable margin
for Term SOFR Loans equal to 3.10% (or 2.00% for base rate loans), in each
case, subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
Amended Credit Agreement. Except as set forth in Amendment No. 9 and the
Amended Credit Agreement, the other terms and conditions of the Amendment
No. 9 Replacement Term Loans are consistent with the term loans outstanding
immediately prior to the effectiveness of Amendment No. 9.

The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
terms of Amendment No. 9 (including the Amended Credit Agreement attached
thereto). A copy of Amendment No. 9 is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and
is incorporated by reference herein.
