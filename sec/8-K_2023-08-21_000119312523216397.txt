On August 21, 2023, AppLovin Corporation (“AppLovin”) entered into an       
agreement to repurchase 15,000,000 shares of its Class A common stock, par  
value $0.00003 per share (the “Class A Common Stock”), beneficially owned by
KKR Denali Holdings L.P. (“KKR Denali”) in a private transaction at a price 
per share of $36.85, for an aggregate purchase price of $552.75 million (the
“Share Repurchase Agreement”). This represents an approximately 3.6%        
discount to the closing price of $38.23 of the Class A Common Stock at the  
close of trading on August 18, 2023 and an approximately 5.4% discount to   
the five day volume-weighted average trading price of $38.96 of the Class A 
Common Stock for the period ended August 18, 2023. The repurchase of the    
shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to the Share Repurchase Agreement is
expected to close by August 28, 2023. The Share Repurchase Agreement        
contains customary representations, warranties and covenants of the parties.
A special committee of the Board of Directors of AppLovin (the “Special     
Committee”), comprised solely of independent directors not affiliated with  
KKR Denali, approved the Share Repurchase Agreement. The foregoing summary  
is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Share     
Repurchase Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is       
incorporated by reference.                                                  
                            
  Item 8.01  Other Events.  
                            
As of August 20, 2023, approximately $107.4 million remained available under
AppLovin’s previously authorized $1.046 billion share repurchase program. On
August 20, 2023, the Special Committee, pursuant to authority delegated to  
it by the Board of Directors of AppLovin, authorized an increase of         
approximately $448 million such that up to $555 million of Class A Common   
Stock may be repurchased. Following the closing of the repurchase of the    
shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to the Share Repurchase Agreement of
$552.75 million, $2.25 million of Class A Common Stock will remain available
for repurchase under the share repurchase program. Repurchases under        
AppLovin’s share repurchase program may be made from time to time through   
open market purchases or through privately negotiated transactions subject  
to market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant      
factors. Open market repurchases may be structured to occur in accordance   
with the requirements of Rule 10b-18. AppLovinmay also, from time to time,  
enter into Rule 10b5-1 plansto facilitate repurchases of its shares under   
this authorization. The repurchase program does not obligate AppLovin to    
acquire any particular amount of its Class A common stock, and may be       
suspended at any time at AppLovin’s discretion.
