Item 2.02 Results of Operations and
Financial Condition
On February 14, 2024, AppLovin Corporation
(“AppLovin” or the “Company”) issued a
press release announcing its financial
results for the quarter ended December 31,
2023 and issued a letter to its
shareholders. A copy of the press release
and shareholder letter are attached as
Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 to this current
report on Form 8-K and are incorporated by
reference herein.

The information in this Item 2.02 of this
current report on Form 8-K and the related
exhibits attached hereto shall not be
deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the “Exchange Act”) or otherwise
subject to the liabilities of that
section, nor shall it be deemed
incorporated by reference in any filing
under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, or the Exchange Act, regardless
of any general incorporation language in
such filing.
                                          
  Item 8.01 Other Events.                 
                                          
As of February 8, 2024, approximately $2.2
million remained available under
AppLovin’s share repurchase program. On
February 8, 2024, the Board of Directors
of AppLovin authorized an increase of
$1.25 billion such that up to $1.252
billion of Class A Common Stock may be
repurchased under the share repurchase
program following this increase.
Repurchases may be made from time to time
through open market purchases or through
privately negotiated transactions subject
to market conditions, applicable legal
requirements and other relevant factors.
Open market repurchases may be structured
to occur in accordance with the
requirements of Rule 10b-18. AppLovin may
also, from time to time, enter into Rule
10b5-1 plans to facilitate repurchases of
its shares under this authorization. The
repurchase program does not obligate
AppLovin to acquire any particular amount
of its Class A common stock, and may be
suspended at any time at AppLovin’s
discretion.
