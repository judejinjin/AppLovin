  Item 1.01.  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.  
                                                           
On February 29, 2024, AppLovin Corporation (the “Company”) entered 
into an underwriting agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) with 
KKR Denali Holdings L.P. (the “Selling Stockholder”) and BofA      
Securities, Inc., acting for themselves and as representative of   
the several underwriters named in Schedule I to the Underwriting   
Agreement (collectively, the “Underwriters”), in connection with   
the previously announced secondary public offering (the “Offering”)
of 19,866,397 shares (the “Securities”) of the Company’s Class A   
common stock, par value $0.00003 per share (the “Class A common    
stock”), by the Selling Stockholder at a price to the public of    
$56.00 per share. Subject to completion of the Offering and        
pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, the Company agreed to      
repurchase from the Underwriters 10,466,397 shares of Class A      
common stock to be sold to the Underwriters by the Selling         
Stockholder in the Offering at a price per share of $54.46 (the    
“Concurrent Repurchase”), which is the same per share price to be  
paid by the Underwriters to the Selling Stockholder in the         
Offering. The Underwriting Agreement contains customary            
representations, warranties, and covenants of the Company and the  
Selling Stockholder and also provides for customary indemnification
by each of the Company, the Selling Stockholder and the            
Underwriters against certain liabilities. The Offering and         
Concurrent Repurchase are expected to close on or around March 6,  
2024, subject to the satisfaction of the customary closing         
conditions in the Underwriting Agreement. The Company will not     
receive any proceeds from the sale of the Class A common stock by  
the Selling Stockholder in the Offering. In connection with the    
Offering, the Selling Stockholder is expected to elect to convert  
approximately 16,000,000 shares of Class B common stock of the     
Company into an equivalent number of shares of Class A common stock
of the Company for no consideration. The foregoing description of  
the Underwriting Agreement does not purport to be complete and is  
subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the full
