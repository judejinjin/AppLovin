Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On March 14, 2024, AppLovin Corporation (“AppLovin” or “Company”)
entered into Amendment No. 10 (“Amendment No. 10”) to that certain
Credit Agreement, dated as of August 15, 2018, by and among
AppLovin, as borrower, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative
agent and collateral agent, and the other parties thereto, as
amended by Amendment No. 1 to the Credit Agreement, dated as of
April 23, 2019, Amendment No. 2 to the Credit Agreement, dated as
of April 27, 2020, Amendment No. 3 to the Credit Agreement, dated
as of May 6, 2020, Amendment No. 4 to the Credit Agreement, dated
as of October 27, 2020, Amendment No. 5 to the Credit Agreement,
dated as of February 12, 2021, Amendment No. 6 to the Credit
Agreement, dated as of October 25, 2021, Amendment No. 7 to the
Credit Agreement, dated January 3, 2023, Amendment No. 8 to the
Credit Agreement, dated June 12, 2023, and Amendment No. 9 to the
Credit Agreement, dated August 18, 2023 (the “Credit Agreement”;
the Credit Agreement as amended by Amendment No. 10, the “Amended
Credit Agreement”).

In connection with and pursuant to Amendment No. 10, the Company
voluntarily prepaid a portion of the term loans extended pursuant
to Amendment No. 6 outstanding immediately prior to the
effectiveness of Amendment No. 10, and certain lenders agreed to
provide refinancing term loans in an aggregate amount of
$1,463,750,000 (such refinancing term loans, the “Amendment No.
10-I Replacement Term Loans”), the proceeds of which were used to
refinance the remainder of such term loans. The Amendment No. 10-I
Replacement Term Loans have (a) a maturity date of October 25, 2028
(or if not a business day, the immediately preceding business day),
(b) an interest rate “floor” of 50 basis points if such loans bear
interest based on the secured overnight financing rate (such loans,
“Term SOFR Loans”), and (c) an applicable margin for Term SOFR
Loans equal to 2.5% (or 1.5% for base rate loans), in each case,
subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
Amended Credit Agreement. Except as set forth in Amendment No. 10
and the Amended Credit Agreement, the other terms and conditions of
the Amendment No. 10-I Replacement Term Loans are consistent with
the term loans outstanding immediately prior to the effectiveness
of Amendment No. 10.

In addition, pursuant to Amendment No. 10, certain lenders agreed
to provide incremental and refinancing term loans in an aggregate
amount of $2,092,500,000 (such loans being referred to as the
“Initial Term Loans”), certain of the proceeds of which were used
to refinance all term loans (other than term loans extended
pursuant to Amendment No. 6) outstanding immediately prior to the
effectiveness of Amendment No. 10. The Initial Term Loans have (a)
a maturity date of August 18, 2030 (or if not a business day, the
immediately preceding business day), (b) an interest rate “floor”
of 50 basis points if such loans are Term SOFR Loans, and (c) an
applicable margin for Term SOFR Loans equal to 2.5% (or 1.5% for
base rate loans), in each case, subject to and in accordance with
the terms and conditions of the Amended Credit Agreement. Except as
set forth in Amendment No. 10 and the Amended Credit Agreement, the
other terms and conditions of the Initial Term Loans are consistent
with the term loans outstanding immediately prior to the
effectiveness of Amendment No. 10.

The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference
to the terms of Amendment No. 10 (including the Amended Credit
Agreement attached thereto). A copy of Amendment No. 10 is attached
hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated by reference herein.
