  Item 7.01  Regulation FD Disclosure  
                                       
On November 19, 2024, AppLovin Corporation (the “Company”) is      
commencing a series of meetings that are part of the Company’s     
efforts to transition to an all unsecured debt capital structure,  
following the Company’s receipt of investment grade ratings from   
each of S&P Global Ratings (BBB-)and Fitch Ratings (BBB-). The     
Company has received customary syndication commitments from a group
of banks, led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative      
agent, for a new, unsecured revolving credit facility that would   
provide for borrowings of up to $1,000 million (the “Proposed      
Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility”). Closing of the Proposed     
Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility is conditioned upon the        
termination of the Company’s existing senior secured credit        
facility and the repayment of the secured term loans thereunder    
with cash or with the proceeds of long-term unsecured debt         
financing, or a combination of both. In furtherance of the         
foregoing objectives, the Company is holding a series of meetings  
with potential fixed income investors on November 19, 2024. No     
assurances can be made as to whether the Company will be able to   
close upon the Proposed Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility or as  
to the structure, size or outcome of any proposed unsecured debt   
transaction. The information in this current report on Form 8-Kand 
the exhibits attached hereto shall not be deemed “filed” for       
purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as  
amended (the “Exchange Act”) or otherwise subject to the           
liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by
reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as       
amended, or the Exchange Act, regardless of any general            
incorporation language in such filing.
