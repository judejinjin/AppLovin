Indenture and the Notes                                            
                                                                   
On December 5, 2024, AppLovin Corporation (the “Company”),         
completed a public offering of $1,000 million aggregate principal  
amount of 5.125% Senior Notes due 2029 (the “2029 Notes”), $1,000  
million aggregate principal amount of 5.375% Senior Notes due 2031 
(the “2031 Notes”), $1,000 million aggregate principal amount of   
5.500% Senior Notes due 2034 (the “2034 Notes”) and $550 million

“2054 Notes” and, collectively with the 2029 Notes, the 2031 Notes 
and the 2034 Notes, the “Notes”). The Notes were offered and sold  
pursuant to the Company’s automatically effective shelf            
registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-272328) (the           
“Registration Statement”) filed with the Securities and Exchange   
Commission (the “SEC”) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the “Securities Act”), on June 1, 2023. The net proceeds from the 
sale of the Notes were approximately $3,519 million after deducting
the underwriters’ discount but before other expenses and will be   
used to repay in full its senior secured term loan facility due    
2028 and its senior secured term loan facility due 2030.           
                                                                   
The Notes are governed by the Indenture, dated as of December 5,   
2024 (the “Base Indenture”), between the Company and Wilmington    
Trust, National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”), as        
supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of      
December 5, 2024, between the Company and the Trustee (the “First  
Supplemental Indenture” and, together with the Base Indenture, the 
“Indenture”).                                                      
                                                                   
The Notes will accrue interest from December 5, 2024 and will be   
payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each  
year, beginning on June 1, 2025. The 2029 Notes will accrue        
interest at a rate of 5.125% per annum and will mature on December 
1, 2029. The 2031 Notes will accrue interest at a rate of 5.375%   
per annum and will mature on December 1, 2031. The 2034 Notes will

December 1, 2034. The 2054 Notes will accrue interest at a rate of 
5.950% per annum and will mature on December 1, 2054.

the 2054 Notes) (each such date, a “par call date”), the Company   
may redeem the applicable series of Notes at the Company’s option, 
in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, at a       
redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount and
rounded to three decimal places) equal to the greater of: (1) (a)  
the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments  
of principal and interest on the Notes to be redeemed discounted to
the redemption date (assuming that such Notes matured on their     
applicable par call date), on a semi-annual basis (assuming a      
360-day year composed of twelve 30-day months) at a rate equal to  
the Treasury Rate (as defined in the First Supplemental Indenture),
plus 15 basis points in the case of the 2029 Notes, 20 basis points
in the case of the 2031 Notes, 20 basis points in the case of the  
2034 Notes and 25 basis points in the case of the 2054 Notes less

principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed; plus, in either case,
accrued and unpaid interest on the applicable Notes to the         
redemption date. On or after the applicable par call date for each 
series of Notes, the Company may redeem the Notes of such series in
whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, at a          
redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes
being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the    
redemption date.                                                   
                                                                   
The foregoing description of the Base Indenture, the First         
Supplemental Indenture and the Notes do not purport to be complete 
and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text  
of the Base Indenture, the First Supplemental Indenture and the    
form of global notes representing the 2029 Notes, the 2031 Notes,  
the 2034 Notes and the 2054 Notes, which are attached hereto as    
Exhibits 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 4.6, respectively, and are    
incorporated by reference herein.                                  
                                                                   
In connection with the offering of the Notes, the Company is filing
as Exhibit 5.1 hereto an opinion of counsel addressing the validity
of the Notes. Such opinion is incorporated by reference into the   
Registration Statement.                                            
                                                                   
Credit Agreement                                                   
                                                                   
On December 5, 2024, the Company entered into an unsecured credit  
agreement, with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent,
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., BofA Securities, Inc., Citibank, N.A.,  
Goldman Sachs Bank USA and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. as  
joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners and with certain other  
financial institutions, as lenders (the “Unsecured Revolving Credit
Facility”). The obligations of the Company under the Unsecured     
Revolving Credit Facility are unsecured and will not be guaranteed 
by any of our subsidiaries. Aggregate commitments under the        
Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility total $1,000 million (with a   
$100 million letter of credit sublimit). The Unsecured Revolving   
Credit Facility matures on December 5, 2029 (subject to two one-   
year extensions that may be requested under the terms of the       
Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility). The Unsecured Revolving      
Credit Facility also provides for an uncommitted accordion feature 
that allows the Company to request an increase in commitments under
the Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility by up to an additional     
$1,000 million.                                                    
                                                                   
The Company may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under the      
Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility, subject to prior written      
notice, minimum amount requirements and customary “breakage” costs.
Amounts prepaid under the Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility may  
subsequently be reborrowed.                                        
                                                                   
Borrowings under the Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility will bear 
interest, with respect to U.S. Dollar borrowings, based on our     
election of either (1) a base rate per annum equal to the highest  
of (i) the prime rate then in effect, (ii) the federal funds rate, 
plus 0.500% and (iii) the Term SOFR rate for a one-month interest  
period, plus 1.100%, in each case subject to a 1.000% floor, plus  
the Applicable Margin or (2) the Term SOFR rate for the applicable 
interest period plus the Applicable Margin plus 0.100%. The        
Applicable Margin in connection with base rate borrowings will     
range, based on the applicable public debt credit rating of the    
Company, from 0.125% to 1.000%. The Applicable Margin in connection
with Term SOFR rate borrowings will range, based on the applicable 
public debt credit rating of the Company, from 1.125% to 2.000%.   
The fee for unused commitments under the Unsecured Revolving Credit
Facility will range, based on the applicable public debt credit    
rating of the Company, from 0.100% to 0.325%.                      
                                                                   
The Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility includes usual and         
customary provisions for unsecured revolving credit agreements of  
this type, including covenants limiting, with certain exceptions   
(1) incurrence of indebtedness by our subsidiaries, (2) liens, (3) 
fundamental changes and (4) sale and leaseback transactions;       
provided that the foregoing covenants will allow for subsidiary    
indebtedness, liens and attributable debt in respect of outstanding
sale and leaseback transactions in an aggregate amount of up to the
greater of (i) 15% of Consolidated Total Assets and (ii) $1,000    
million. In addition, the Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility      
requires that we maintain a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt (net  
of up to $1,000 million of Unrestricted cash and Permitted         
Investments) to Consolidated EBITDA (each as defined in the        
Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility) not to exceed 3.50 to 1.00    
that shall be tested as of the end of any fiscal quarter for the   
four fiscal quarter period ending on such date, provided that at   
the option of the Company in connection with an acquisition in     
which the aggregate cash consideration therefor (including assumed 
or refinanced debt and deferred purchase price obligations) exceeds
$1,500 million, such ratio may be increased to 4.00 to 1.00 for the
four fiscal quarter periods ending with the fiscal quarter in which
such acquisition occurs and with the three fiscal quarters         
thereafter.                                                        
                                                                   
The foregoing description of the Unsecured Revolving Credit        
Facility does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its   
entirety by reference to the full text of the Unsecured Revolving  
Credit Facility, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is

Credit Facility and concurrently with the sale of the Notes, on
