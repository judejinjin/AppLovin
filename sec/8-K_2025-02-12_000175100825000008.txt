  Item 8.01    Other Events  
                             
On February 12, 2025, the Company announced that it had entered
into a term sheet for the sale of the Company’s mobile gaming
business to a privately held company (the “Acquirer”) for total
consideration of $900 million (the “Term Sheet”). The Term Sheet
provides for the total consideration to consist of $400 million in
shares of the Acquirer’s common equity and $500 million in cash,
subject to customary purchase price adjustments. The Term Sheet
also provides that the Acquirer will borrow up to $250 million of
the cash portion of the total consideration and that, if the
Acquirer is unable to obtain such financing, the Company agrees to
provide financing in such amount to the Acquirer through the
issuance of a promissory note. The Term Sheet is non-binding,
except with respect to an agreement by the parties to use
commercially reasonable best efforts in good faith to negotiate and
finalize definitive agreements for the proposed transaction, a
prohibition on the Company engaging in discussions or negotiations
with any third party other than the Acquirer regarding the sale of
the Company’s mobile gaming business for a specified period, and
customary terms such as fees and expenses, governing law, and
termination.
