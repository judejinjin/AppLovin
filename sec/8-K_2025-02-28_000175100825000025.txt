  Item 8.01    Other Events  
                             
As of February 27, 2025, AppLovin Corporation (the “Company”) had
approximately $1.772 billion remaining available under its share
repurchase program (the “Existing Repurchase Maximum Amount”), of
which the amount that may be repurchased in any fiscal quarter was
limited to the amount of the Company’s Free Cash Flow (as defined
in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission) in the preceding fiscal quarter.

On February 28, 2025, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized
the modification of the share repurchase program as follows: (i)
$500 million shall be immediately available for repurchase of
shares of the Company’s Class A common stock (the “Current Limit”),
notwithstanding the amount that otherwise would have remained
available during the quarter under the prior Free Cash Flow
limitation, and (ii) the Current Limit shall be increased in future
quarters by the amount of Free Cash Flow generated in the preceding
fiscal quarter, with the Current Limit and any increases to be
carried forward and remain available for future repurchases if not
used and the aggregate amount that may be repurchased not to exceed
the Existing Repurchase Maximum Amount. The modifications do not
change the Existing Repurchase Maximum Amount.

Repurchases may be made from time to time through open market
purchases or through privately negotiated transactions subject to
market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant
factors. Open market repurchases may be structured to occur in
accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18. The Company may
also, from time to time, enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans to facilitate
repurchases of its shares under this authorization. The repurchase
program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular
amount of its Class A common stock, and may be suspended at any
time at the Company’s discretion.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on
its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
