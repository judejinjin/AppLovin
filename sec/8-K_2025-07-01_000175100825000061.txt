Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On June 30, 2025, AppLovin Corporation (“AppLovin”) and Tripledot
(“Purchaser Parent”) entered into an amendment (the “Amendment”) to
that certain Purchase Agreement, dated as of May 7, 2025 by and
among AppLovin, its subsidiaries Morocco, Inc. and AppLovin GmbH
(collectively with AppLovin, the “Sellers”), Purchaser Parent, and
its subsidiaries Eton Games, Inc. (“Eton”) and Tripledot Group
Holdings Limited (collectively, with Purchaser Parent, the
“Purchasers”), (as amended, the “Purchase Agreement”, and the
transactions contemplated thereby, the “Transactions”) to provide,
among other things, that in lieu of the issuance of a secured
promissory note by Eton to AppLovin or its designated affiliate at
the closing of the Transactions (the “Closing”) to fund a portion
of the full Cash Consideration (as defined in the Purchase
Agreement), Purchaser Parent may elect to pay such amount in cash.
The foregoing description of the Amendment does not purport to be
complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full
text of the Amendment, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 2.1,
and the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference.

On June 30, 2025, AppLovin and the Sellers completed the Closing
under the Purchase Agreement. At Closing, AppLovin transferred the
equity interests of certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries that
are engaged in AppLovin’s mobile gaming business to the Purchasers
for consideration consisting of (i) $400.0 million in cash
consideration, subject to closing adjustments, and (ii) equity
consideration comprised of ordinary shares of Purchaser Parent
representing approximately 20% of the fully-diluted equity
capitalization of Purchaser Parent at the time of the Closing. No
promissory note was issued as part of the purchase consideration.
