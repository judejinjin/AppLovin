review of the Company’s Registration Statement on Form S-1(File No.

accompanied by the Company’s request for confidential treatment for selected
portions of this letter. The Company has filed a separate letter with the
Office of Freedom of Information and Privacy Act Operations in connection
with the confidential treatment request, pursuant to Rule 83 of the
Commission’s Rules on Information and Requests, 17 C.F.R. § 200.83. For the
Staff’s reference, we have enclosed a copy of the Company’s letter to the
Office of Freedom of Information and Privacy Act Operations, as well as a
copy of this correspondence, marked to show the portions redacted from the
version filed via EDGAR and for which the Company is requesting confidential
treatment. The Company supplementally advises the Staff that on February 26,
2021, representatives of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities
LLC, the lead underwriters (the “ Lead Underwriters”) for the Company’s
initial public offering (“ IPO”), on behalf of the underwriters, advised the
Company that, based on then-current market conditions, they anticipated that
the underwriters would recommend to the Company a preliminary price range of
$[****] to $[****] per share (the “ Preliminary Price Range”), resulting in
a midpoint of the Preliminary Price Range of $[****] per share (the “
Midpoint Price”). The Company further advises the Staff that the Preliminary
Price Range represents the Company’s belief of what the indicative price
range to be disclosed in the preliminary prospectus may be, but that the
actual indicative price range to be included in the preliminary prospectus
will not be determined until the Company completes a valuation process with
the underwriters. This valuation process is expected to occur shortly before
the filing of the preliminary prospectus for the commencement of the
roadshow for the IPO. Therefore, the Preliminary Price Range is subject to
further change, which may result from various factors, including then-
current market conditions and subsequent business, market, and other
developments affecting the Company. The indicative price range to be
included in the preliminary prospectus, when determined, will be included in
an amendment to the Registration Statement prior to the distribution of any
preliminary prospectuses to potential investors. Summary of Valuation
Reports To facilitate the Staff’s review, the table below contains a
complete list of all shares of the Company’s Class A common stock (the “
Class A common stock”) underlying equity awards granted in the last six
months of the Company’s fiscal year 2020 (the “ Review Period”) together
with the underlying Class A common stock fair value per share used for
financial reporting purposes. The Company has not made any other equity
incentive grants during the Review Period. AppLovin Corporation requests
that the information contained in this letter, marked by brackets, be
treated as confidential information pursuant to 17 C.F.R. §200.83.

For financial reporting purposes, the Company retrospectively assessed the
fair value used for computing stock-based compensation expense for equity
grants after considering the fair value reflected on the relevant Valuation
Report and other facts and circumstances on the date of grant, and used
linear interpolation to determine the estimated fair value, when considered
appropriate. For the grants made in July, November and December, the Company
determined the grant-date fair value was $24.89, $51.83, $56.28 and $68.78
per share. The Company determined the fair value per share as of these dates
by linearly interpolating on a daily basis the increase between the fair
value per share of the Company’s Class A common stock from June 1, 2020 to
August 31, 2020 and from August 31, 2020 to November 30, 2020, as set forth
in the Valuation Reports that calculated the fair value per share of the
Company’s Class A common stock shortly prior to and shortly after the date
of grant. The June 1, 2020 Valuation Report determined that the fair value
of the Company’s Class A common stock was $7.45 per share. The August 31,
2020 Valuation Report determined that the fair value of the Company’s Class
A common stock was $35.59 per share. The November 30, 2020 Valuation Report
determined that the fair value of the Company’s Class A common stock was
$59.42 per share. For the grants made on December 30, 2020, the Company used
linear interpolation on a daily basis from the November 30, 2020 Valuation
Report to the Midpoint Price to determine the fair value for financial
reporting purposes. The Company believes that this straight-line methodology
provides the most reasonable basis for the valuation of its Class A common
stock because it did not identify any single event that occurred from June
1, 2020 through the date of the December Grants that would have caused a
material change in fair value. The June 1, 2020 Valuation Report employed an
Option Pricing Methodology ( “OPM”) while the August 31, 2020 Valuation
Report and November 30, 2020 Valuation Report employed a scenario analysis
using the Probability-Weighted Expected Return Method (“ PWERM”), whereby
such reports considered five potential future scenarios for the Company.
Each of the scenarios assumed a shareholder exit, either through:
                                              
  •    IPO (four exit scenarios modeled), or

Analysis of Differences Between Stock-Based Compensation Expense for July,
November and December Grants and Midpoint Price As noted above, the
Preliminary Price Range is between $[****] to $[****] per share of Class A
common stock. The Preliminary Price Range was determined based, in part, on
discussions among the management of the Company, the Pricing Committee of
the Board, and the Lead Underwriters. In addition, the Preliminary Price
Range was derived using a combination of valuation methodologies that differ
from that used by the Board and the Valuation Reports. The valuation
methodologies considered in deriving the Preliminary Price Range included
the valuations of comparable or similar publicly-traded companies across a
range of metrics, with a primary focus on revenue, earnings before interest,
taxes and depreciation & amortization (“ EBITDA”) as well as revenue and
EBITDA growth. The Company believes the principal factors that contributed
to the differences between the Midpoint Price, and the per share fair value
of the Company’s Class A common stock used to record stock-based
compensation expense for the July, November and December grants, were as
follows:
                                                                            
       Company performance. The Preliminary Price Range was informed by an  
       accelerating of the                                                  
       Company’s business results, in particular late in the fourth         
       quarter of 2020. In the quarter ended December 31, 2020, the         
  •    Company reported revenue of $510 million, compared to $279 million   
       for the quarter ended December 31,                                   
       2019, representing growth of 83% and exceeding internal              
       projections, and Adjusted EBITDA of $148 million for the quarter     
       ended December 31, 2020,

  compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $82 million for the  
  quarter ended December 31, 2019. Two main drivers

       The Company implemented its AXON machine-learning recommendation     
       engine in August 2020, and fully launched the                        
  •    system in December 2020, significantly enhancing the efficacy of     
       the Company’s marketing software solution, AppDiscovery. As a        
       result of Axon, the Company was able to accelerate its total         
       revenue growth rate.                                                 
                                                                            
                                                                            
       The Company’s Consumer revenue, as a result of acquisitions,         
       partnerships and new game launches in 2020,                          
       increased significantly during 2020, growing from $112 million in    
       the quarter ended December 31, 2019 to $254 million in the quarter   
  •    ended December 31, 2020, representing a 127% increase                
       year-over-year and exceeding internal                                
       projections. In addition, the Company launched “Project Makeover”    
       in late November 2020, which grew within two months of launch to     
       become the #1 free app and #4 grossing app on the iOS platform in    
       the United States.                                                   
                                                                            
                                                                            
       Robust public equity market valuations. The Preliminary Price Range  
       took into account the strong                                         
  •    recent performance of similar or comparable publicly-traded          
       companies, and the favorable dynamics for relevant initial public    
       offerings of larger scale technology companies, as outlined below:   
                                                                            
                                                                            
       The trading prices of comparable companies used by the Lead          
       Underwriters in recommending the Preliminary Price

  •    on February 12, 2021.

       Based on the Company’s recent financial performance and current      
       market sentiment, the Company expects that                           
       there will be positive investor interest in the IPO. The capital     
       markets continue to reward high-growth technology companies in       
       expanding addressable markets with exposure to favorable industry    
       trends such as increasing demand for software                        
       solutions. Of note, since November 30, 2020, a number of             
       large-scale, high-growth technology companies have completed         
       initial public offerings and have realized over 100% increases in    
       per share valuations relative to their respective initial            
  •    filing ranges.

       Since August 31, 2020, the Company has taken several steps towards   
       the completion of an IPO, including                                  
       holding “testing the waters” meetings, at which the Company          
       received feedback from potential investors, engaging ten additional  
       underwriters, and publicly filing the Registration Statement with    
  •    the Commission.

       Discount for illiquidity. The Preliminary Price Range represents a   
       future price for shares of                                           
       Class A common stock that, if issued in the IPO, would be            
       immediately freely tradable in a public market, whereas the          
       estimated fair values of the Class A common stock as of June 1,      
       2020, August 31, 2020 and November 30,

       value of shares that were then illiquid and might never become

  for a discount due to lack of marketability. The discount for lack of     
  marketability for the Company’s Class A common stock was 22.5% as of      
  June 1, 2020, was between 17.5% and 22.5% as of August 31, 2020 and was   
  between 15.0% and 20.0% as of November 30, 2020. This differential        
  accounts for part of the increases from the estimated fair value for the  
  July, November and December grants and the Midpoint Price.

       IPO uncertainty. Unlike the valuation methodologies used in          
       connection with the Company’s                                        
       historical equity issuances, the Preliminary Price Range does not    
       take into account the probability of alternative outcomes that       
       could yield lower valuations, such as a sale transaction at          
       differing valuations or that the Company may continue as a           
       private, stand-alone entity. Therefore, the Preliminary Price Range  
  •    effectively weighs a near-term IPO outcome at 100%. In contrast,     
       the various Valuation Reports and determinations made by the         
       Company weighted the probability of a successful IPO                 
       within one year of the measurement date at a substantially lower     
       probability. Given the uncertainty in the capital markets as a       
       result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the probability of consummating a   
       successful IPO                                                       
       was far from certain at the time of the June, August and November    
       Valuation Reports.                                                   
                                                                            
                                                                            
       Conversion of Preferred Stock to Common Stock. The holders of the    
       Company’s Series A preferred                                         
       stock currently enjoy substantial economic rights and preferences    
       over the holders of its Class A common stock. The Preliminary Price  
  •    Range assumes the conversion of all of the Company’s Series A        
       preferred stock upon the completion of its                           
       IPO. The corresponding elimination of the preferences and rights     
       enjoyed by the holders of Series A preferred stock results in a      
       higher valuation of the Company’s Class A common stock, which is     
       reflected in the Preliminary Price Range.                            
                                                                            
                                                                            
       Uncertainty due to COVID. The Company made its determination of the  
       fair value of the                                                    
       Company’s Class A common stock as of June 1, 2020, August 31, 2020   
       and November 30, 2020 taking into account, among other factors, the  
       uncertainty and volatility created by the                            
       COVID-19 pandemic, including its impact on economic growth, the      
       interest rate environment, and global economic trends. This was      
       particularly true as of June 1, 2020 when the uncertainty caused by  
       the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the Company’s ability to forecast     
       revenue for use in the Valuation Reports. As additional information  
       has become available regarding the actual impact of the COVID-19     
       pandemic, the forecasts for the Company’s revenue continued to be    
  •    adjusted in light of evolving information.                           
 ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 
                                                                            
Based on the above analysis, the Company respectfully submits to the Staff
that the determination of the fair value of its Class A common stock
described above was in accordance with ASC Topic 718 and consistent with the
AICPA Practice Guide. Further, the Company believes that the stock-based
compensation expense that it recorded related to the July, November and
December grants is appropriate in light of the foregoing analysis. *****
