clarify that the comparison is from the quarter prior to acquisition to the

      We note that you disclose Adjusted EBITDA Margin as a Non-GAAP        
      measure. Please expand the disclosure to include the most directly    
      comparable GAAP financial measure for Adjusted EBITDA Margin with     
  2.  equal or greater prominence. Refer to Item 10(e)(1)(i)(A) of

      Please also revise the disclosure on pages 79, 87 and 102             
      accordingly.                                                          
                                                                            
The Company respectfully advises the Staff that it has revised its
disclosures on pages 18, 80, 87, and 102 to address the Staff’s comment.
                                                                            
      We note on page 87 that in the calculation of your non-GAAP           
      measure “Adjusted EBITDA” you make an adjustment identified as        
      “Purchase accounting impact to deferred revenue.” Considering         
      deferred revenue was adjusted to fair value at the time of            
  3.  acquisition pursuant to GAAP, this non-GAAP adjustment intended to    
      eliminate the impact of purchase accounting substitutes an            
      individually tailored recognition and measurement method for GAAP.    
      Please tell us how you considered the guidance of                     
      Question 100.04 of the Division’s Non-GAAP C&DIs and Rule 100(b) of   
      Regulation G when presenting this measure.                            
                                                                            
The Company respectfully advises the Staff that it has revised its
disclosures on pages 2, 18, 80, 82, 86, 87, 102, and 119 to address the
Staff’s comment.
                                                                            
      Refer to your disclosure of Adjusted EBITDA on pages 2 and 119. We    
      note that you include a                                               
      reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP net income (loss) but that  
      you also discuss your strong cash flow immediately following the      
  4.  discussion of Adjusted EBITDA. Please clarify whether you believe     
      Adjusted EBITDA is a performance measure or a                         
      liquidity measure in the disclosures. Also, clarify why you do not    
      believe that Cash Flow from Operations is the most directly           
      comparable GAAP financial measure due to the close proximity of your  
      discussion of Adjusted EBITDA to cash flows.                          
                                                                            
The Company respectfully advises the Staff that it has revised its
disclosures on pages 2, 82, and 119 to address the Staff’s comment. The
Company advises the Staff that it believes Adjusted EBITDA is a performance
measure, and as such reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) as the
most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“ U.S.
GAAP”). The Company notes that its qualitative disclosures on pages 2, 82,
and 119 relating to cash flows were intended to describe its cash flows from
operations, not Adjusted EBITDA, and the Company believes its revised
disclosures clarify this distinction.

The Company respectfully advises the Staff that its write-offs have not been
material for any of the periods presented in the Registration Statement, and
as such it has not separately itemized the details of such write-offs in the

million and $0.9 million in write-offs related to certain property and
equipment and intangible assets in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Management’s

      of your belief that the registrant’s financial statements alone

      Financial Reporting Codification section 506.02(c)(ii) for guidance.  
                                                                            
The Company respectfully advises the Staff that it has considered the
pending acquisition (the “ Adjust Acquisition”) of Adjust GmbH (“ Adjust”)
in accordance Rule 3-05of Regulation S-X(“ Rule 3-05”) using the conditions
specified in the definition of significant subsidiary in Rule 1-02(w)of
Regulation S-X(the “ Significance Tests”). Investment Test The Company
measured the significance of the Adjust Acquisition using the investment
test by comparing the consideration to be transferred of $996.4 million
against the total assets of the Company and its subsidiaries consolidated as
of December 31, 2020 of $2.15 billion (the “ 2020 Total Company Assets”).
Based on these amounts, the Company determined that the Adjust Acquisition
is significant at a level of 46% under the investment test.

U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission March 22, 2021 Page 5 Asset Test The
Company measured the significance of the Adjust Acquisition using the asset
test by comparing the consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2020 of
Adjust of $117.2 million 1against the 2020 Total Company Assets and
determined that the Adjust Acquisition is significant at a level of 5% under
the asset test. Income Test The Company measured the significance of the
Adjust Acquisition using the income test by comparing Adjust’s revenue in
2020 of $97.2 million against the Company’s revenue in 2020 of $1.45 billion
and determined that the Adjust Acquisition is significant at a level of 7%
under the income test. Because the Adjust Acquisition was not significant at
a level of greater than 20% based the revenue component of the income test,
the Company did not measure the significance of the Adjust Acquisition using
the net income component of the income test. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of
Rule 3-05,financial statements required for periods specified in paragraph
(b)(2) of Rule 3-05may be omitted in specified circumstances, including if
(i) the significance of such transaction does not exceed any of the
Significance Tests at the 50% level and (ii) either (A) the consummation of
the acquisition has not yet occurred, or (B) the date of the final
prospectus relating to an offering as filed with the Commission pursuant to
Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, is no more than 74
days after consummation of the business acquisition, and the financial
statements have not previously been filed by the registrant. The Company
respectfully advises the Staff that (i) the significance of the Adjust
Acquisition does not exceed any of the Significance Tests at the 50% level;
and (ii) the consummation of the Adjust Acquisition has not occurred. The
Company further advises the Staff that it expects to consummate the Adjust
Acquisition in the second quarter of 2021 and intends to file financial
statements as required under Rule 3-05and Article 11 pro forma information
on a Form 8-Kno more than 75 days after consummation of the Adjust
Acquisition in accordance with Rule 3-05(b)(4)(ii)of Regulation S-X.
                                                                            
     Adjust’s financial statements were prepared in accordance with         
     International Financial Reporting                                      
     Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting           
     Standards Board and are presented in Euros. The Company has not        
     identified any material differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP that    
     would impact the Significance Tests.                                   
     For purposes of the Significance Tests, the Company applied a          
     currency conversion rate of 1.14, based on the average conversion      
     rate of Euros to U.S. Dollars for 2020, to Adjust’s 2020 revenue and   
     applied a currency conversion rate of 1.20,                            
     based on the conversion rate of Euros to U.S. Dollars on December 31,  
  1  2020, to Adjust’s total assets as of December 31, 2020.

U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission March 22, 2021 Page 6 The Company
has also considered the Commission’s amendments to the investment test
adopted in May 2020, which permit a registrant to use the aggregate
worldwide market value of its voting and non-votingcommon equity, calculated
daily from the last five trading days of the most recently completed month
ending prior to the earlier of the registrant’s announcement date or
agreement date of the acquisition or disposition (the “ Aggregate Market
Value”) as the denominator when measuring significance using the investment
test. The Company notes that, had it completed its initial public offering
prior to entering into the definitive agreement related to the Adjust
Acquisition such that it could use the Aggregate Market Value rather than
the 2020 Total Company Assets as the denominator in measuring significance
using the investment test, and assuming a worldwide market value based on
the midpoint of the preliminary price range disclosed to the Staff in its
correspondence on March 4, 2021, the Adjust Acquisition would not have been
significant at a level of greater than 20%. The Company respectfully advises
the Staff that on page 90 it has disclosed certain summary consolidated
statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income data for Adjust
for 2019 and 2020 to provide investors with a view of the relative scale of
Adjust compared to the Company. The Company believes its financial
statements, taken together with the existing and additional disclosures
regarding Adjust, would provide adequate information for an IPO investor to
make an investment decision.
                                                                            
       Refer to the Exchange Agreements on page 165 regarding the Equity    
       Award Exchange Agreement entered                                     
       into with Mr. Chen for stock options with 2.4 million underlying     
       Class A shares that gives Mr. Chen the right to                      
       receive Class B shares instead of Class A shares. Please tell us     
  10.  the consideration given to ASC 718-20-35-2A in your accounting for   
       this modification, including how you determined the fair value of    
       the modified award as compared to the original award. If material,   
       revise the disclosure to include                                     
       subsequent event disclosure of this agreement and the additional     
       expense recorded in conjunction with this modification of the stock  
       incentive award.                                                     
                                                                            
The Company respectfully advises the Staff that it has considered the Equity
Award Exchange Agreement entered into with Mr. Chen regarding stock options
to purchase 2,360,400 shares of Class A common stock that gives Mr. Chen the
right, following the exercise of such stock options, to exchange such shares
for shares of Class B common stock in accordance with ASC 718-20-35-2Ato
determine if the Equity Award Exchange Agreement should be accounted for as
a modification of such stock options. The Company considered the structure
of both classes of underlying shares in order to assign value to two
separate stock attributes: voting rights and economic value. With respect to
the economic value, both Class A common stock and Class B common stock
(which only is created upon filing of the Company’s amended and restated
certificate of incorporation, which will occur following effectiveness of
the Company’s IPO and in connection with the closing of the IPO) are
entitled to the same participation in the economic results generated by the
Company, including dividends, distributions and price of sale.

U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission March 22, 2021 Page 7 With respect
to voting rights, Class B common stock will have 20 votes per share compared
to Class A common stock with one vote per share; however, none of the
holders of Class B common stock will individually be able to control the
voting power of the Company due to a voting agreement that has been entered
into between the holders of Class B common stock, whereby all Class B common
stock held by the holders of Class B common stock and their respective
permitted entities and permitted transferees will be voted as determined by
two of Adam Foroughi, Herald Chen, and KKR Denali Holdings, L.P. (one of
which must be Mr. Foroughi). In addition to other events that may trigger
the conversion of shares of Class B common stock to shares of Class A common
stock, each share of Class B common stock will convert automatically into
one share of Class A common stock upon the date fixed by the Company’s board
of directors that is no less than 61 days and no more than 180 days
following the date on which the voting agreement is terminated. In addition,
the voting right cannot be transferred in a subsequent sale, as Class B
common stock must convert to Class A common stock in order to be monetized.
In considering the value of the voting rights, the Company also considered
the guidance in ASC 820, even though the awards are not directly in the
scope of ASC 820. The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
Accounting and Valuation Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held Company Equity
Securities Issued as Compensation states “…FASB ASC 820 applies when another
FASB ASC topic requires or permits fair value measurements or disclosures
about fair value measurements; however, FASB ASC 820-10-15-2states that the
guidance in FASB ASC 820 does not apply to accounting principles that
address share-based payment transactions. Therefore, FASB ASC 820 is not
required to be used as definitive guidance when valuing share-based payments
granted under FASB ASC 718. However, while acknowledging that the
measurement principle under FASB ASC 718 is fair value based, largely
because pre-vestingconditions are not considered in the calculation of
compensation cost, there are concepts within FASB ASC 820 that may be
helpful when measuring the cost of share-based payments” … “The Equity
Securities Task Force (the “ task force”) also believes that FASB ASC 820
contains many concepts that entities may find helpful when estimating the
fair value of the underlying equity shares in a share-based payment award
measured under FASB ASC 718. Therefore, the task force recommends referring
to the general measurement guidance in FASB ASC 820 for purposes of
estimating the fair value of the underlying equity shares that is used to
measure a share-based payment award issued within the scope of FASB ASC
718.” As such, the Company evaluated the guidance in ASC 820 in its fair
value consideration from a market participant perspective, noting that a
market participant would not ascribe any value to the voting rights. The
Company therefore believes that the economic values of both classes of stock
are undifferentiated.

       Stockholders “and certain related entities”                          
       will automatically convert their Class A shares to Class B shares    
  11.  prior to effectiveness of the IPO. Please include detailed           
       disclosure of the capital structure change as a subsequent

       disclosure the terms of the new classes on common stock and whether

       Class B common stock. If not, disclose your accounting methodology   
       for the change in capital structure regarding any preferential       
       treatment of certain investors (i.e. special stock dividends).
