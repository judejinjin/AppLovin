General
                                                                            
      We note that you entered into a definitive agreement to acquire       
      MoPub for approximately                                               
      $1.05 billion. Please tell us what consideration you have given to    
  1.  providing financial statements and pro forma financial information    
      for MoPub pursuant to Rule 3-05 and                                   
      Article 11 of Regulation S-X. Please provide the significance         
      computations set forth in Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X to support   
      your conclusions.                                                     
                                                                            
The Company respectfully advises the Staff that it has considered the
financial statements and pro forma financial information requirements of
Rule 3-05of Regulation S-X(“ Rule 3-05”) and Article 11 of Regulation S-X(“
Article 11”) related to its pending acquisition of MoPub (the “ MoPub
Acquisition”). Based on the Company’s significance computations using the
conditions specified in the definition of significant subsidiary in Rule
1-02(w)of Regulation S-X(the “ Significance Tests”), the Company has
determined that the pending MoPub Acquisition does not meet the 20%
significance level on any of the Significance Tests, as set forth in more
detail below. Investment Test The Company measured the significance of the
MoPub Acquisition using the investment test by comparing the estimated
consideration to be transferred of $1.01 billion against the aggregate
worldwide market value of the Company’s voting and non-votingcommon equity.
In determining the aggregate worldwide market value of the Company’s voting
and non-votingcommon equity, the Company used the average of such aggregate
worldwide market value calculated daily for the last five trading days of
the Company’s most recently completed month ending prior to the earlier of
the Company’s announcement date or agreement date of the MoPub Acquisition,
which was September. The Company calculated such aggregate worldwide market
value as $17.0 billion. For the avoidance of doubt, the aggregate worldwide
market value was determined based on only the Company’s Class A common
stock, and not its Class B common stock, because its Class B common stock
does not represent traded common equity until a conversion into Class A
common stock occurs. Based on these amounts, the investment test resulted in
a significance of approximately 6%. Asset Test The Company measured the
significance of the MoPub Acquisition using the asset test by comparing the
consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2020 of MoPub of $[****]
against the consolidated total assets of the Company and its subsidiaries as
of December 31, 2020 of $2.15 billion. Based on these amounts, the asset
test resulted in a significance of approximately [****]%. Income Test The
Company measured the significance of the MoPub Acquisition by first using
the revenue component of the income test by comparing MoPub’s revenue in
2020 of $[****] against the Company’s revenue in 2020 of $1.45 billion.
Based on these amounts, the revenue component of the income test

resulted in a significance of approximately [****]%. Because the MoPub
Acquisition is not significant at a level of greater than 20% based the
revenue component of the income test, the Company did not measure the
significance of the MoPub Acquisition using the net income component of the
income test. As such, pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of Rule 3-05,because none
of the Significance Tests exceeds 20%, MoPub financial statements are not
required for the MoPub Acquisition. Relatedly, because MoPub financial
statements are not required pursuant to Rule 3-05,no pro forma financial
information is required under Article 11. In addition, the Company also
performed the Significance Tests for all individually insignificant
businesses acquired or to be acquired since the beginning of 2021, including
MoPub, in aggregate (the “ Aggregated Insignificant Businesses”). Based on
the Company’s significance computations using the Significance Tests, the
Company has determined that the Aggregated Insignificant Businesses do not
meet the 50% significance level on any of the Significance Tests. As such,
pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of Rule 3-05and Article 11, pro forma
financial information is not required for the Aggregated Insignificant
Businesses. For the avoidance of doubt, the Aggregated Insignificant
Businesses exclude the significant acquisition of adjust GmbH for which
financial statements and pro forma financial information has been provided
in the Registration Statement.
