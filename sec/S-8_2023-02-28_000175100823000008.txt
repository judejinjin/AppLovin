Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law authorizes a
corporation’s board of directors to grant, and authorizes a court to award,
indemnity to officers, directors, and other corporate agents.

The Registrant’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains
provisions that limit the liability of its directors for monetary damages to
the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law.
Consequently, the Registrant’s directors will not be personally liable to
the Registrant or its stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of
fiduciary duties as directors, except liability for the following:

• any breach of their duty of loyalty to the Registrant or its stockholders;

• any act or omission not in good faith or that involves intentional
misconduct or a knowing violation of law;

• unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or
redemptions as provided in Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation
Law; or

• any transaction from which they derived an improper personal benefit.

Any amendment to, or repeal of, these provisions will not eliminate or
reduce the effect of these provisions in respect of any act, omission, or
claim that occurred or arose prior to that amendment or repeal. If the
Delaware General Corporation Law is amended to provide for further
limitations on the personal liability of directors of corporations, then the
personal liability of the Registrant’s directors will be further limited to
the greatest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law.

In addition, the Registrant’s amended and restated bylaws provide that the
Registrant will indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any
person who is or was a party or is threatened to be made a party to any
action, suit, or proceeding by reason of the fact that they are or were one
of the Registrant’s directors or officers or is or was serving at the
Registrant’s request as a director or officer of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise. The Registrant’s
amended and restated bylaws provide that the Registrant may indemnify to the
fullest extent permitted by law any person who is or was a party or is
threatened to be made a party to any action, suit, or proceeding by reason
of the fact that he or she is or was one of the Registrant’s employees or
agents or is or was serving at the Registrant’s request as an employee or
agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other
enterprise. The Registrant’s amended and restated bylaws will also provide
that the Registrant must advance expenses incurred by or on behalf of a
director or officer in advance of the final disposition of any action or
proceeding, subject to limited exceptions.

Further, the Registrant has entered into indemnification agreements with
each of its directors and executive officers that may be broader than the
specific indemnification provisions contained in the Delaware General
Corporation Law. These indemnification agreements require the Registrant,
among other things, to indemnify its directors and executive officers
against liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service.
These indemnification agreements also require the Registrant to advance all
expenses incurred by the directors and executive officers in investigating
or defending any such action, suit, or proceeding. The Registrant believes
that these agreements are necessary to attract and retain qualified
individuals to serve as directors and executive officers.

The limitation of liability and indemnification provisions in the
Registrant’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and
restated bylaws and the indemnification agreements that the Registrant has
entered into with its directors and executive officers may discourage
stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against the Registrant’s directors and
executive officers for breach of their fiduciary duties. They may also
reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against the Registrant’s
directors and executive officers, even though an action, if successful,
might benefit the Registrant and other stockholders. Further, a
stockholder’s investment may be adversely affected to the extent that the
Registrant pays the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors
and executive officers as required by these indemnification provisions.

The Registrant has obtained insurance policies under which, subject to the
limitations of the policies, coverage is provided to the Registrant’s
directors and executive officers against loss arising from claims made by
reason of breach of fiduciary duty or other wrongful acts as a director or
executive officer, including claims relating to public securities matters,
and to the Registrant with respect to payments that may be made by the
Registrant to these directors and executive officers pursuant to its
indemnification obligations or otherwise as a matter of law.

Certain of the Registrant’s non-employee directors may, through their
relationships with their employers, be insured or indemnified against
certain liabilities incurred in their capacity as members of the
Registrant’s Board of Directors.

Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act
may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling the
Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, the Registrant has been
informed that, in the opinion of the Commission, such indemnification is
against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore
unenforceable.

A. The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes:

(1) To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a
post-effective amendment to this Registration Statement:

(i) To include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities
Act;

(ii) To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the
effective date of the Registration Statement (or the most recent post-
effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate,
represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the
Registration Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or
decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of
securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any
deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range
may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission
pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and
price represent no more than a 20 percent change in the maximum aggregate
offering price set forth in the “Calculation of Registration Fee” table in
the effective Registration Statement; and

(iii) To include any material information with respect to the plan of
distribution not previously disclosed in the Registration Statement or any
material change to such information in the Registration Statement.

Provided, however , that paragraphs (A)(1)(i) and (A)(1)(ii) do not apply if
the information required to be included in a post-effective amendment by
those paragraphs is contained in reports filed with or furnished to the
Commission by the Registrant pursuant to Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the
Exchange Act that are incorporated by reference in this Registration
Statement.

(2) For the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act,
each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration
statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of
such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide
offering thereof.

(3) It will remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment
any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the
termination of the offering.

B. The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes that, for purposes of
determining any liability under the Securities Act, each filing of the
Registrant’s annual report pursuant to Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the
Exchange Act (and, where applicable, each filing of an employee benefit
plan’s annual report pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act) that is
incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement shall be deemed to
be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein,
and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the
initial bona fide offering thereof.

C. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities
Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the
Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the
Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Commission such
indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act
and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for
indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the
Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or
controlling person of the Registrant in the successful defense of any
action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or
controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the
Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been
settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate
jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against
public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the
final adjudication of such issue.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the
registrant certifies that it has reasonable grounds to believe that it meets
all of the requirements for filing on Form S-8 and has duly caused this
Registration Statement to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned,
thereunto duly authorized in the City of Palo Alto, California, on February
28, 2023.
