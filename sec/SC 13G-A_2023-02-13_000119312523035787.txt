  Item 4.  Ownership.  
                       
(a) Amount beneficially owned: The reporting person holds a total of
4,696,459 shares of common stock of the Issuer, based on (i) 80,199 shares
of Class A Common Stock of the Issuer held by the reporting person, (ii)
50,000 shares of Class A Common Stock of the Issuer held by Herald Y. & Mei
K. Chen, as trustees of The Chen Family 2012 Irrevocable Trust, for which
the reporting person and his spouse serve as co-trustees(the “Chen Family
Trust”), (iii) 1,956,059 shares of Class B Common Stock of the Issuer held
by the reporting person, (iv) 330,000 shares of Class B Common Stock of the
Issuer held by The Chen Family Trust, and (v) 2,280,201 shares of Class A
Common Stock subject to options held by Mr. Chen that are exercisable within
60 days of December 31, 2022. The ownership percentage in Row 11 of the
cover page is calculated based on 302,711,061 shares of Class A Common Stock
outstanding as of December 31, 2022, as reported by the Issuer to the
reporting person, plus the assumed exercise of 2,280,201 shares of Class A
Common Stock subject to options held by Mr. Chen and conversion of 2,286,059
shares of Class B Common Stock deemed beneficially owned by Mr. Chen into
shares of Class A Common Stock. Each share of Class B Common Stock is
convertible into one share of Class A Common Stock at the option of the
holder and has no expiration date. Each share of Class B Common Stock is
entitled to twenty votes per share, whereas each share of Class A Common
Stock is entitled to one vote per share. The rights of the holders of Class
A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock are identical, except with respect
to the aforementioned conversion rights and voting rights. In addition, Mr.
Chen, Adam Foroughi, co-founder,Chief Executive Officer, and the Chairperson
of the board of directors of the Issuer, and KKR Denali Holdings L.P. (“KKR
Denali”) (collectively with certain affiliates, the “Voting Agreement
Parties”) are parties to a Voting Agreement (the “Voting Agreement”), which
contains certain provisions relating to voting of securities of the Issuer
by the parties thereto. Pursuant to the Voting Agreement, two of Mr.
Foroughi, Mr. Chen, and KKR Denali (one of which must be Mr. Foroughi) have
the authority to direct the vote of all shares of Class B Common Stock, and
all other shares of capital stock of the Issuer, held by the Voting
Agreement Parties and their respective permitted entities and permitted
transferees on all matters to be voted upon by stockholders.

By virtue of the Voting Agreement and the obligations and rights thereunder,
the reporting person acknowledges and agrees that he is acting as a “group”
within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
with the other Voting Agreement Parties and/or certain of their affiliates.
The reporting person expressly disclaims beneficial ownership over any
shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock that he may be deemed
to beneficially own solely by reason of the Voting Agreement. Mr. Foroughi
and KKR Denali have separately made Schedule 13G filings reporting their
beneficial ownership of shares of Class A Common Stock. Pursuant to an
equity exchange right agreement entered into between the Issuer and Mr. Chen
(the “Equity Award Exchange Agreement”), Mr. Chen has a right (but not an
obligation) to require the Issuer to exchange any shares of Class A Common
Stock received upon the exercise of options to purchase shares of Class A
Common Stock for an equivalent number of shares of Class B Common Stock.
This right applies only to equity awards granted to Mr. Chen prior to the
effectiveness of the filing of the Issuer’s amended and restated certificate
of incorporation in connection with the Issuer’s initial public offering.
There are 2,280,201 shares of Class A Common Stock subject to options and
80,199 shares of Class A Common Stock issued upon exercise of options held
by Mr. Chen that are subject to the Equity Award Exchange Agreement and may
be exchanged, upon exercise, for an equivalent number of shares of Class B
Common Stock.
