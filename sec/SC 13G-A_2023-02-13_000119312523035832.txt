  (a)  Amount beneficially owned:  
                                   
The reporting person holds a total of 27,936,907 shares of Class B Common
Stock of the Issuer. Each share of Class B Common Stock is convertible into
one share of Class A Common Stock at the option of the holder and has no
expiration date. Each share of Class B Common Stock is entitled to twenty
votes per share, whereas each share of Class A Common Stock is entitled to
one vote per share. The rights of the holders of Class A Common Stock and
Class B Common Stock are identical, except with respect to the
aforementioned conversion rights and voting rights. In addition, Mr.
Foroughi, Herald Chen, President and Chief Financial Officer, and a member
of the board of directors of the Issuer, and KKR Denali Holdings L.P. (“KKR
Denali”) (collectively with certain affiliates, the “Voting Agreement
Parties”) are parties to a Voting Agreement (the “Voting Agreement”), which
contains certain provisions relating to voting of securities of the Issuer
by the parties thereto. Pursuant to the Voting Agreement, two of Mr.
Foroughi, Mr. Chen, and KKR Denali (one of which must be Mr. Foroughi) have
the authority to direct the vote of all shares of Class B Common Stock, and
all other shares of capital stock of the Issuer, held by the Voting
Agreement Parties and their respective permitted entities and permitted
transferees on all matters to be voted upon by stockholders. By virtue of
the Voting Agreement and the obligations and rights thereunder, the
reporting person acknowledges and agrees that he is acting as a “group”
within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
with the other Voting Agreement Parties and/or certain of their affiliates.
Based in part on information reported by the Issuer to the reporting person,
such a “group” would be deemed to beneficially own an aggregate of
134,308,022 shares of Class A Common Stock, based on 63,145,400 shares of
Class A Common Stock (including options to purchase 2,280,201 shares of
Class A Common Stock held by Mr. Chen that are exercisable within 60 days of
December 31, 2022) and 71,162,622 shares of Class B

Common Stock, each of which is convertible into one share of Class A Common
Stock, which represents 35.7% of the Class A Common Stock of the Issuer, as
of December 31, 2022, calculated pursuant to Rule 13d-3.The ownership
percentage above is calculated based on 302,711,061 shares of Class A Common
Stock outstanding as of December 31, 2022, as reported by the issuer to the
reporting person, plus the assumed exercise of 2,280,201 shares of Class A
Common Stock held by Mr. Chen and conversion of 71,162,622 shares of Class B
Common Stock deemed beneficially owned by such “group” into shares of Class
A Common Stock. Mr. Chen and KKR Denali have separately made Schedule 13G
filings reporting their beneficial ownership of shares of Class A Common
Stock.
