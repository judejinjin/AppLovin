  (a)  Amount beneficially owned:  
                                   
KKR Denali holds a total of 43,355,379 shares of common
stock of the Issuer, based on (i) 4,449,890 shares of Class
A Common Stock of the Issuer and (ii) 38,905,489 shares of
Class B Common Stock of the Issuer convertible at any time
at the option of the holder into 38,905,489 shares of Class
A Common Stock of the Issuer, representing approximately
14.3% of the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock
calculated pursuant to Rule 13d-3 of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (“Rule 13d-3”). Calculations of the
Class A Common Stock beneficially owned are based on
264,638,950 shares of Class A Common Stock of the Issuer
outstanding as of November 2, 2023, as reported in the
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed by the Issuer with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on November 8, 2023 plus
the 38,905,489 shares of Class B Common Stock convertible at
any time at the option of KKR Denali into 38,905,489 shares
of Class A Common Stock, which shares will also convert
automatically upon certain events specified in the Issuer’s
amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Class A
Common Stock has one vote per share, Class B Common Stock
has 20 votes per share, and Class C common stock has no
voting rights. The common stock held by the Reporting
Persons represents 12.9% of the total common stock of the
Issuer outstanding, based on 264,638,950 shares of Class A
Common Stock and 71,162,622 shares of Class B Common Stock
of the Issuer outstanding as of November 2, 2023, as
reported in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed by the
Issuer with the Securities and Exchange Commission on
November 8, 2023. Each of KKR Denali GP (as the general
partner of KKR Denali); KKR Americas Fund (as the sole
member of KKR Denali GP); KKR Associates (as the general
partner of KKR Americas Fund); KKR Americas Limited (as the
general partner of KKR Associates); KKR Group Partnership

KKR Group Co. (as the sole shareholder of KKR Group
Holdings); KKR & Co. (as the sole shareholder of KKR Group
Co.) and KKR Management (as the Series I preferred

beneficial owner of the securities held by KKR Denali. KKR
Denali GP, KKR Americas Fund, KKR Associates, KKR Americas
Limited, KKR Group Partnership, KKR Group Holdings, KKR
Group Co., KKR & Co. and KKR Management disclaim beneficial
ownership of such securities. As the founding partners of
KKR Management, Messrs. 15 Henry R. Kravis and George R.
Roberts may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of the
securities reported herein, but disclaim beneficial
ownership of such securities. Adam Foroughi, co-founder,
Chief Executive Officer, and the Chairperson of the board of
directors of the Issuer, Herald Chen, President and Chief
Financial Officer, and a member of the board of directors of
the Issuer, and KKR Denali (collectively with certain
affiliates, the “Voting Agreement Parties”) are parties to a
Voting Agreement (the “Voting Agreement”), which contains
certain provisions relating to voting of securities of the
Issuer by the parties thereto. Pursuant to the Voting
Agreement, two of Mr. Foroughi, Mr. Chen, and KKR Denali
(one of which must be Mr. Foroughi) have the authority to
direct the vote of all shares of Class B Common Stock as
well as any other shares of the Company’s capital stock held
by the Voting Agreement Parties and their respective
permitted entities and permitted transferees on all matters
to be voted upon by stockholders. By virtue of the Voting
Agreement and the obligations and rights thereunder, the
Reporting Persons acknowledge and agree that they are acting
as a “group” within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 with the other Voting
Agreement Parties and/or certain of their affiliates. The
Reporting Persons expressly disclaim beneficial ownership
over any shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common
Stock that they may be deemed to beneficially own solely by
reason of the Voting Agreement. Messrs. Foroughi and Chen
are separately making Schedule 13G filings reporting their
beneficial ownership of shares of Class A Common Stock.
