  (a)  Amount beneficially owned:  
                                   
The reporting person holds a total of
4,662,064 shares of common stock of the
Issuer, based on (i) 80,199 shares of
Class A Common Stock of the Issuer held by
the reporting person, (ii) 50,000 shares
of Class A Common Stock of the Issuer held
by Herald Y. & Mei K. Chen, as trustees of
The Chen Family 2012 Irrevocable Trust,
for which the reporting person and his
spouse serve as co-trustees(the “Chen
Family Trust”), (iii) 1,906,059 shares of
Class B Common Stock of the Issuer held by
the reporting person, (iv) 330,000 shares
of Class B Common Stock of the Issuer held
by The Chen Family Trust, (v) 2,280,201
shares of Class A Common Stock of the
Issuer subject to options held by Mr. Chen
that are exercisable within 60 days of
December 31, 2023, and (vi) 15,605 shares
of Class A Common Stock of the Issuer
subject to restricted stock units held by
Mr. Chen that will vest within 60 days of
December 31, 2023. The ownership
percentage in Row 11 of the cover page is
calculated based on 268,774,090 shares of
Class A Common Stock outstanding as of
December 31, 2023, as reported by the
Issuer to the reporting person, plus the
assumed exercise or vesting, as applicable
of 2,280,201 shares of Class A Common
Stock subject to options and 15,605
restricted stock units held by Mr. Chen,
and conversion of 2,236,059 shares of
Class B Common Stock deemed beneficially
owned by Mr. Chen into shares of Class A
Common Stock. Each share of Class B Common
Stock is convertible into one share of
Class A Common Stock at the option of the
holder and has no expiration date. Each
share of Class B Common Stock is entitled
to twenty votes per share, whereas each
share of Class A Common Stock is entitled
to one vote per share. The rights of the
holders of Class A Common Stock and Class
B Common Stock are identical, except with
respect to the aforementioned conversion
rights and voting rights. In addition, Mr.
Chen, Adam Foroughi, co-founder,Chief
Executive Officer, and the Chairperson of
the board of directors of the Issuer, and
KKR Denali Holdings L.P. (“KKR Denali”)
(collectively with certain affiliates, the
“Voting Agreement Parties”) are parties to
a Voting Agreement (the “Voting
Agreement”), which contains certain
provisions relating to voting of
securities of the Issuer by the parties
thereto. Pursuant to the Voting Agreement,
two of Mr. Foroughi, Mr. Chen, and KKR
Denali (one of which must be Mr. Foroughi)
have the authority to direct the vote of
all shares of Class B Common Stock, and
all other shares of capital stock of the
Issuer, held by the Voting Agreement
Parties and their respective permitted
entities and permitted transferees on all
matters to be voted upon by stockholders.

By virtue of the Voting Agreement and the
obligations and rights thereunder, the
reporting person acknowledges and agrees
that he is acting as a “group” within the
meaning of Section 13(d) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 with the other Voting
Agreement Parties and/or certain of their
affiliates. The reporting person expressly
disclaims beneficial ownership over any
shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B
Common Stock that he may be deemed to
beneficially own solely by reason of the
Voting Agreement. Mr. Foroughi and KKR
Denali have separately made Schedule 13G
filings reporting their beneficial
ownership of shares of Class A Common
Stock. Pursuant to an equity exchange
right agreement entered into between the
Issuer and Mr. Chen (the “Equity Award
Exchange Agreement”), Mr. Chen has a right
(but not an obligation) to require the
Issuer to exchange any shares of Class A
Common Stock received upon the exercise of
options to purchase shares of Class A
Common Stock for an equivalent number of
shares of Class B Common Stock. This right
applies only to equity awards granted to
Mr. Chen prior to the effectiveness of the
filing of the Issuer’s amended and
restated certificate of incorporation in
connection with the Issuer’s initial
public offering. As of December 31, 2023,
there were 2,280,201 shares of Class A
Common Stock subject to options and 80,199
shares of Class A Common Stock issued upon
exercise of options held by Mr. Chen
subject to the Equity Award Exchange
Agreement that may be exchanged, upon
exercise, for an equivalent number of
shares of Class B Common Stock.
