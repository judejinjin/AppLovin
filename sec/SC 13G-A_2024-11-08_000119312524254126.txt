  (a)  Amount beneficially owned:  
                                   
The reporting person holds a total of 3,885,217 shares of Class A
Common Stock of the Issuer (including 1,477,929 shares of Class A
Common Stock subject to restricted stock units held by the
reporting person that are exercisable within 60 days of September
30, 2024) and 27,936,907 shares of Class B Common Stock of the
Issuer. Each share of Class B Common Stock is convertible into one
share of Class A Common Stock at the option of the holder and has
no expiration date. Each share of Class B Common Stock is entitled
to twenty votes per share, whereas each share of Class A Common
Stock is entitled to one vote per share. The rights of the holders
of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock are identical,
except with respect to the aforementioned conversion rights and
voting rights. In addition, Mr. Foroughi, Herald Chen, a member of
the board of directors of the Issuer, and KKR Denali Holdings L.P.
(“KKR Denali”) (collectively with certain affiliates, the “Voting
Agreement Parties”) are parties to a Voting Agreement (the “Voting
Agreement”), which contains certain provisions relating to voting
of securities of the Issuer by the parties thereto. Pursuant to the
Voting Agreement, two of Mr. Foroughi, Mr. Chen, and KKR Denali
(one of which must be Mr. Foroughi) have the authority to direct
the vote of all shares of Class B Common Stock, and all other
shares of capital stock of the Issuer, held by the Voting Agreement
Parties and their respective permitted entities and permitted
transferees on all matters to be voted upon by stockholders. By
virtue of the Voting Agreement and the obligations and rights
thereunder, the reporting person acknowledges and agrees that he is
acting as a “group” within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 with the other Voting Agreement
Parties and/or certain of their affiliates. Based in part on
information reported by the Issuer to the reporting person, such a
“group” would be deemed to

beneficially own an aggregate of 43,307,451 shares of Class A
Common Stock, consisting of 6,383,421 shares of Class A Common
Stock (including 2,280,201 shares of Class A Common Stock subject
to options held by Mr. Chen that are exercisable within 60 days of
September 30, 2024, 15,604 shares of Class A Common Stock subject
to restricted stock units held by Mr. Chen that will vest within 60
days of September 30, 2024, and 1,477,929 shares of Class A Common
Stock subject to restricted stock units held by Mr. Foroughi that
will vest within 60 days of September 30, 2024) and 36,924,030
shares of Class B Common Stock, each of which is convertible into
one share of Class A Common Stock, which represents 12.8% of the
Class A Common Stock of the Issuer, as of September 30, 2024,
calculated pursuant to Rule 13d-3.The ownership percentage above is
calculated based on 298,557,111 shares of Class A Common Stock
outstanding as of September 30, 2024, as reported by the Issuer to
the reporting person, plus the assumed exercise or vesting, as
applicable of 2,280,201 shares of Class A Common Stock subject to
options held by Mr. Chen, 15,604 shares of Class A Common Stock
subject to restricted stock units held by Mr. Chen, and 1,477,929
shares of Class A Common Stock subject to restricted stock units
held by Mr. Foroughi, and conversion of 36,924,030 shares of Class
B Common Stock deemed beneficially owned by such “group” into
shares of Class A Common Stock. Mr. Chen and KKR Denali have
separately made Schedule 13G filings reporting their beneficial
ownership of shares of Class A Common Stock.
