  (a)  Amount beneficially owned:  
                                   
As of September 30, 2024, KKR Denali beneficially held an aggregate
of 5,342,283 shares of Class A Common Stock of the Issuer based on
(i) 136,794 shares of Class A Common Stock of the Issuer directly
held and (ii) 5,205,489 shares of Class B Common Stock, par value
$0.00003 per share (the “Class B Common Stock”), of the Issuer
directly held convertible at any time at the option of the holder
into 5,205,489 shares of Class A Common Stock of the Issuer,
representing approximately 1.8% of the outstanding shares of Class
A Common Stock calculated pursuant to Rule 13d-3 of the Act, as
amended (“Rule 13d-3”). Calculations of the Class A Common Stock
beneficially owned are based on 298,557,111 shares of Class A
Common Stock of the Issuer outstanding as of September 30, 2024, as
reported in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed by the Issuer
with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 6, 2024
(the “Form 10-Q”) plus the 5,205,489 shares of Class B Common Stock
convertible at any time at the option of KKR Denali into 5,205,489
shares of Class A Common Stock, which shares will also convert
automatically upon certain events specified in the Issuer’s amended
and restated certificate of incorporation. Class A Common Stock has
one vote per share, Class B Common Stock has 20 votes per share,
and Class C common stock has no voting rights. The common stock
held by the Reporting Persons represents 1.6% of the total common
stock of the Issuer outstanding, based on 298,557,111 shares of
Class A Common Stock and 36,924,030 shares of Class B Common Stock
of the Issuer outstanding as of September 30, 2024, as reported in
the Form 10-Q. Each of KKR Denali GP (as the general partner of KKR
Denali); KKR Americas Fund (as the sole member of KKR Denali GP);
KKR Associates (as the general partner of KKR Americas Fund); KKR
Americas Limited (as the general partner of KKR Associates); KKR
Group Partnership (as 15 the sole shareholder of KKR Americas
Limited); KKR Group Holdings (as the general partner of KKR Group
Partnership); KKR Group Co. (as the sole shareholder of KKR Group
Holdings); KKR & Co. (as the sole shareholder of KKR Group Co.),
and KKR Management (as the Series I preferred stockholder of KKR &
Co.) may also be deemed to be the beneficial owner of the
securities held by KKR Denali. KKR Denali GP, KKR Americas Fund,
KKR Associates, KKR Americas Limited, KKR Group Partnership, KKR
Group Holdings, KKR Group Co., KKR & Co. and KKR Management
disclaim beneficial ownership of such securities. As the founding
partners of KKR Management, Messrs. Henry R. Kravis and George R.
Roberts may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of the securities
reported herein, but disclaim beneficial ownership of such
securities. Adam Foroughi, co-founder, Chief Executive Officer, and
the Chairperson of the board of directors of the Issuer, Herald
Chen, the former President and Chief Financial Officer, and a
member of the board of directors of the Issuer, and KKR Denali
(collectively with certain affiliates, the “Voting Agreement
Parties”) are parties to a Voting Agreement (the “Voting
Agreement”), which contains certain provisions relating to voting
of securities of the Issuer by the parties thereto. Pursuant to the
Voting Agreement, two of Mr. Foroughi, Mr. Chen, and KKR Denali
(one of which must be Mr. Foroughi) have the authority to direct
the vote of all shares of Class B Common Stock as well as any other
shares of the Company’s capital stock held by the Voting Agreement
Parties and their respective permitted entities and permitted
transferees on all matters to be voted upon by stockholders. By
virtue of the Voting Agreement and the obligations and rights
thereunder, the Reporting Persons acknowledge and agree that they
are acting as a “group” within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the
Act with the other Voting Agreement Parties and/or certain of their
affiliates. The Reporting Persons expressly disclaim beneficial
ownership over any shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common
Stock that they may be deemed to beneficially own solely by reason
of the Voting Agreement. Messrs. Foroughi and Chen are separately
making Schedule 13G filings reporting their beneficial ownership of
shares of Class A Common Stock.
