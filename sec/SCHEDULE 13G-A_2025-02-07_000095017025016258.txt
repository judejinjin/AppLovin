           Common Stock of the Issuer held by Herald Y. & Mei K.   
           Chen, as trustees of The Chen Family 2012 Irrevocable

           outstanding as of December 31, 2024, as reported by     
           the Issuer to the reporting person, plus the assumed

           one share of Class A Common Stock at the option of the  
           holder and has no expiration date. Each share of Class  
           B Common Stock is entitled to twenty votes per share,

           are parties to a Voting Agreement (the "Voting          
           Agreement"), which contains certain provisions          
  (a)      relating to voting of securities of the Issuer by the   
           parties thereto. Pursuant to the Voting Agreement,      
           together, Mr. Foroughi and Mr. Chen have the authority  
           to direct the vote of all shares of Class B Common      
           Stock, and all other shares of capital stock of the     
           Issuer, held by the Voting Agreement Parties and their  
           respective permitted entities and permitted             
           transferees on all matters to be voted upon by          
           stockholders.

           and rights thereunder, the reporting person

           Exchange Act of 1934 with the other Voting Agreement    
           Parties and/or certain of their affiliates. The         
           reporting person expressly disclaims beneficial         
           ownership over any shares of Class A Common Stock or    
           Class B Common Stock that he may be deemed to           
           beneficially own solely by reason of the Voting         
           Agreement. Mr. Foroughi has separately made a Schedule  
           13G filing reporting his beneficial ownership of        
           shares of Class A Common Stock.                         
           Pursuant to an equity exchange right agreement entered  
           into between the Issuer and Mr. Chen (the "Equity       
           Award Exchange Agreement"), Mr. Chen has a right (but   
           not an obligation) to require the Issuer to exchange    
           any shares of Class A Common Stock received upon the    
           exercise of options to purchase shares of Class A       
           Common Stock for an equivalent number of shares of      
           Class B Common Stock. This right applies only to        
           equity awards granted to Mr. Chen prior to the          
           effectiveness of the filing of the Issuer's amended     
           and restated certificate of incorporation in            
           connection with the Issuer's initial public offering.   
           As of December 31, 2024, there were 1,880,201 shares    
           of Class A Common Stock subject to options held by Mr.  
           Chen subject to the Equity Award Exchange Agreement
