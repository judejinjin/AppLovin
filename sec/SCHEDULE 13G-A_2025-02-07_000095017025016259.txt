           of Class A Common Stock of the Issuer (including        
           16,951 shares of Class A Common Stock subject to        
           restricted stock units held by the reporting person     
           that are exercisable within 60 days of December 31,     
           2024) and 27,936,907 shares of Class B Common Stock of  
           the Issuer.                                             
           Each share of Class B Common Stock is convertible into  
           one share of Class A Common Stock at the option of the  
           holder and has no expiration date. Each share of Class  
           B Common Stock is entitled to twenty votes per share,   
           whereas each share of Class A Common Stock is entitled  
           to one vote per share. The rights of the holders of     
           Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock are       
           identical, except with respect to the aforementioned    
           conversion rights and voting rights.                    
           In addition, Mr. Foroughi and Herald Chen, a member of  
           the board of directors of the Issuer (collectively      
           with certain affiliates, the "Voting Agreement          
           Parties") are parties to a Voting Agreement (the        
           "Voting Agreement"), which contains certain provisions  
           relating to voting of securities of the Issuer by the   
           parties thereto. Pursuant to the Voting Agreement,      
           together, Mr. Foroughi and Mr. Chen have the authority  
           to direct the vote of all shares of Class B Common      
           Stock, and all other shares of capital stock of the     
           Issuer, held by the Voting Agreement Parties and their  
           respective permitted entities and permitted             
           transferees on all matters to be voted upon by          
           stockholders.                                           
           By virtue of the Voting Agreement and the obligations   
           and rights thereunder, the reporting person             
  (a)      acknowledges and agrees that he is acting as a "group"  
           within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Securities   
           Exchange Act of 1934 with the other Voting Agreement    
           Parties and/or certain of their affiliates. Based in    
           part on information reported by the Issuer to the       
           reporting person, such a "group" would be deemed to     
           beneficially own an aggregate of 36,337,732 shares of   
           Class A Common Stock, consisting of 5,649,191 shares    
           of Class A Common Stock (including 1,880,201 shares of  
           Class A Common Stock subject to options held by Mr.     
           Chen that are exercisable within 60 days of December    
           31, 2024 and 16,951 shares of Class A Common Stock      
           subject to restricted stock units held by Mr. Foroughi  
           that will vest within 60 days of December 31, 2024)     
           and 30,688,541 shares of Class B Common Stock, each of  
           which is convertible into one share of Class A Common   
           Stock, which represents 10.6% of the Class A Common     
           Stock of the Issuer, as of December 31, 2024,           
           calculated pursuant to Rule 13d-3. The ownership        
           percentage above is calculated based on 309,353,198     
           shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding as of        
           December 31, 2024, as reported by the Issuer to the     
           reporting person, plus the assumed exercise or          
           vesting, as applicable of 1,880,201 shares of Class A   
           Common Stock subject to options held by Mr. Chen, and
