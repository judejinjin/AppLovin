   1.                                                   Please expand the
discussion of Business Revenue to quantify the changes in revenues for
                                                        each type of change,
such as advertising revenue growth from additional Apps developed,
                                                        advertising revenue
growth from existing Apps, if material. Also, please expand the
                                                        discussion to explain
the reason for a decline in Software revenue due to increased usage
                                                        of advertising
inventory by your growing Owned Studios and Partner Studios.

2.       We note your response to comment 4 however we continue to believe that
changes in
         revenues should be addressed on the basis of changes due to price
versus changes in
         volume. While we understand that you may manage your business based on
key metrics,
         this would impact your GAAP segment disclosures rather than addressing
requirements of
         MD&A disclosure. Please revise the MD&A discussion of both Business
and Consumer
         revenues to address changes in revenues, by type of revenue, for
example, in-app
         purchases or fees for removing advertisements for Consumer revenue,
due to changes in
         price and volume of your revenue transactions. These revenue trends
are important and
         are required disclosure regardless of whether the individual revenue
transactions are for
         tangible, intangible or virtual products or services. While we
understand that you may not
         retain user-level data related to Consumer Revenue for historical
periods, revenue
         transaction data utilized in recording revenue under GAAP is the basis
for such price and
         volume changes.

3.       We note that the table does not include amounts related to agreements
governing your
         acquisitions of your Owned Studios and arrangements with Partner
Studios to provide for
         payment contingent upon future performance metrics. Please expand the
disclosure to
         provide sufficient detail of all significant agreements for
transactions not accounted for as
         business combinations so that a reader may clearly understand how
these various
         agreements will impact your future operations.

4.       Refer to your response to comment 12. Please supplementally confirm
that revenue
         generated from durable virtual goods continued to be immaterial in
2020 and 2021 or
         expand your accounting policy to include how estimates of user bases
or user engagement
         impact the lives of virtual items when recognizing Consumer Revenue.
