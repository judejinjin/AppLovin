   1.                                                   We note on page 118
that the apps you "acquired in 2018 and 2019 have increased their
                                                        quarterly revenue over
100% on average" based on a comparison of unaudited revenue for
                                                        such acquired Apps for
the three months prior to the acquisition against your revenue
                                                        from such Apps in the
same period in the subsequent year. Please expand the disclosure
                                                        on pages 5 and 126 to
clarify that the comparison is from the quarter prior to acquisition to
                                                        the same period in the
subsequent year, since the current more abbreviated disclosure
                                                        could be interpreted as
a quarter to consecutive quarter comparison.

2.       We note that you disclose Adjusted EBITDA Margin as a Non-GAAP
measure. Please
         expand the disclosure to include the most directly comparable GAAP
financial measure
         for Adjusted EBITDA Margin with equal or greater prominence. Refer to
Item
         10(e)(1)(i)(A) of Regulation S-K. Please also revise the disclosure on
pages 79, 87 and
         102 accordingly.
3.       We note on page 87 that in the calculation of your non-GAAP measure
Adjusted
         EBITDA    you make an adjustment identified as "Purchase accounting
impact to deferred
         revenue.    Considering deferred revenue was adjusted to fair value at
the time of
         acquisition pursuant to GAAP, this non-GAAP adjustment intended to
eliminate the
         impact of purchase accounting substitutes an individually tailored
recognition and
         measurement method for GAAP. Please tell us how you considered the
guidance of
         Question 100.04 of the Division's Non-GAAP C&DIs and Rule 100(b) of
Regulation G
         when presenting this measure.
4.       Refer to your disclosure of Adjusted EBITDA on pages 2 and 119. We
note that you
         include a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP net income (loss)
but that you also
         discuss your strong cash flow immediately following the discussion of
Adjusted
         EBITDA. Please clarify whether you believe Adjusted EBITDA is a
performance
         measure or a liquidity measure in the disclosures. Also, clarify why
you do not believe
         that Cash Flow from Operations is the most directly comparable GAAP
financial measure
         due to the close proximity of your discussion of Adjusted EBITDA to
cash flows.
5.       Please expand the disclosure on page 86 to describe, in greater
detail, expenses included
         in "write-offs".

6.       Please expand the discussion to explain the business purpose for
amending the terms of
         the asset acquisition agreement to settle the acquisition holdback and
the reason for the
         timing of the agreement. Please also disclose the total value of cash
and Class A common
         stock issued along with the amount of any accrual for contingent
consideration prior to
         entering into the agreement.

7.       Please expand the discussion of revenue changes to quantify each of
the reasons for
         increases in revenues, if material.

8.       We note that you added two of the three paragraphs of proposed
disclosure included in
         your response dated February 9, 2021. Please include the remaining
proposed disclosure,
         "Determining the EAUL is subjective and requires management's
judgment. Future
         playing patterns may differ from historical playing patterns, and
therefore the EAUL may
         change in the future. The EAULs are generally between six and nine
months." or tell us
         the basis for your belief that the disclosure is no longer necessary.
Note 20 - Subsequent Events, page F-47

9.       We note on page 89 that you signed a "definitive" share purchase
agreement with Adjust
         GmbH in February 2021 to acquire all the outstanding shares of Adjust
GmbH for $1
         billion. We also note that you expect to close on this acquisition in
the first half of 2021.
         Please tell us the consideration you have given to Rule 3-05 of
Regulation S-X regarding
         financial statements and Article 11 pro forma financial information
for this acquisition.
         Please provide a detailed analysis of the significance tests and an
explanation of the basis
         of your belief that the registrant's financial statements alone would
or would not provide
         adequate financial information for an IPO investor to make an
investment decision. See
         Financial Reporting Codification section 506.02(c)(ii) for guidance.
10.      Refer to the Exchange Agreements on page 165 regarding the Equity
Award Exchange
         Agreement entered into with Mr. Chen for stock options with 2.4
million underlying Class
         A shares that gives Mr. Chen the right to receive Class B shares
instead of Class A
         shares. Please tell us the consideration given to ASC 718-20-35-2A in
your accounting
         for this modification, including how you determined the fair value of
the modified award
         as compared to the original award. If material, revise the disclosure
to include subsequent
         event disclosure of this agreement and the additional expense recorded
in conjunction
         with this modification of the stock incentive award.
11.      We note on page 1 that references to "common stock" includes your
Class A common
         stock, Class B common stock and Class C common stock. We also note on
page 165 that
         Class B will have 20 votes, Class B shareholders will control the
registrant following the
         IPO and "exchange agreements" with the Class B Stockholders "and
certain related
         entities" will automatically convert their Class A shares to Class B
shares prior to
         effectiveness of the IPO. Please include detailed disclosure of the
capital structure change
         as a subsequent event that occurs prior to effectiveness. Please
include in your disclosure
         the terms of the new classes on common stock and whether all
shareholders prior to the
         capital structure change participated equally in the issuance of Class
B common stock. If
         not, disclose your accounting methodology for the change in capital
structure regarding
         any preferential treatment of certain investors (i.e. special stock
dividends).
